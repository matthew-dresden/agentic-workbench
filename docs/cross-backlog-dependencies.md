# Cross-Backlog Dependencies

## Purpose

A workbench Backlog scopes its work to one set of target repos defined in its `workbench.yaml`. When that work consumes outputs produced by a DIFFERENT Backlog driven by a separate orchestrator (e.g., released artifacts, tagged Terraform module versions, generated SDK bindings), the dependency is "cross-backlog" and cannot be expressed via the in-backlog `## Dependencies` table alone -- the dependent's `## Dependencies` cannot reference task IDs that don't exist in this backlog's `BACKLOG.md` index.

This document is the canonical pattern for representing cross-backlog dependencies: the **manual blocker idiom** (see `manual-blockers.md`), anchored in the dependent backlog and wired into every dependent Task.

## When you have a cross-backlog dependency

You have one if either of these is true:

- A Task in this backlog references modules / packages / images / secrets / DNS records produced by Tasks in a different backlog AND the producer backlog has its own `BACKLOG.md` that this backlog cannot validate against.
- A Task in this backlog reads a tag / release / artifact whose creation is owned by a separate orchestrator that runs against a different `WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT`.

Examples observed in production:

- Backlog A (`example-telemetry-spec/backlog/`) consumes Backlog B (`tf-modules-backlog/`) released terraform-modules tags. 16 Backlog A Tasks reference `example-org/terraform-modules` modules by tag. Backlog B has its own orchestrator and `BACKLOG.md`.
- Backlog A consumes a mpm integration-test fix being authored by another agent in the mpm repo. The fix's completion is verified externally by the operator running mpm's test suite locally.

## The pattern: anchor a manual blocker in this backlog

Create a manual blocker (per `manual-blockers.md`) representing the external dependency. Wire every dependent Task in this backlog to it via `workbench add-dep`.

Convention for placement: the manual blocker lives in `E0-F<N>` (Workspace Bootstrap epic, a new Feature for each external dependency). This keeps cross-backlog gates visible at the top of `BACKLOG.md`'s index, alongside other workspace-level prereqs (symlinks, AWS profiles, etc.).

### Step 1 -- Create the manual blocker

Follow the canonical Story + Task templates from `manual-blockers.md`. The Story's description MUST name the external producer backlog explicitly (e.g., "Backlog B at `tf-modules-backlog/`") and the deliverables this backlog consumes (e.g., "all 14 modules tagged on `example-org/terraform-modules` main"). The Task's `## Acceptance Criteria` MUST include a `AC-MANUAL-001` that is verifiable by an external command (e.g., `gh api repos/<org>/<producer-repo>/tags --jq '.[].name' | sort`).

### Step 2 -- Wire every dependent Task

For each Task in this backlog that consumes the external producer's output:

```bash
WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT=... WORKBENCH_CLAUDE_MODEL=... \
  uv run --project ... workbench add-dep <dependent-task-id> E0-F<N>-S1-T1
```

`add-dep` writes the manual blocker into the dependent's `## Dependencies` table with status `proposed`. When `workbench report` runs, the dependent appears under "Blocked tasks (auto-clearing via proposal)" rather than "needs operator attention" because the cascade-classifier sees a `proposed` blocker as resolvable. Once the operator flips the manual blocker to `done`, every dependent that has only this blocker becomes claimable.

### Step 3 -- Document the unblock procedure

The manual-blocker Task's description MUST list the exact verification commands the operator runs to confirm the external work is complete, plus the `workbench set-status <id> done` invocation that clears the gate. See the example in `manual-blockers.md`.

## Why not represent cross-backlog deps another way

Three alternatives are NOT recommended:

- **In-line `## Dependencies` rows referencing a task ID from another backlog**: `workbench validate-backlog` cannot resolve such IDs (they don't exist in this backlog's index) and will fail validation.
- **Untracked operator memory ("Backlog B should be done before launching A")**: this is what we had in `example-telemetry-spec/BACKLOG.md` preamble; it's enforced at the epic level by prose but NOT at the task level. Result: the orchestrator picks up Backlog B-dependent Tasks before Backlog B has run, fails them, and the operator must intervene per task. The manual-blocker idiom enforces the dependency at task-claim time.
- **Custom "EXTERNAL-" task IDs**: tempting but breaks workbench's ID format regex (`E\d+-F\d+-S\d+-T\d+`) and the parser. If workbench ever grows native cross-backlog awareness, the EXTERNAL prefix could be added as a first-class concept; until then, the manual-blocker idiom is the workaround.

## Worked example: Backlog B gate in example-telemetry-spec

Authoritative implementation in production at `example-telemetry-spec/backlog/E0/E0-F4/`:

- `E0-F4.md` -- Feature description: "Backlog B (terraform-modules) gate"
- `E0-F4-S1/E0-F4-S1.md` -- Story: "Verify Backlog B terraform-modules tags released"
- `E0-F4-S1/E0-F4-S1-T1.md` -- Task: "Backlog B terraform-modules gate -- DO NOT CLAIM"

Wired dependents (16 Tasks across E1 + E2 + E3):

- E1-F5-S1-T1, T2, T3 (DNS zones using route53-record primitive)
- E1-F5-S2-T1 (ACM cert tasks)
- E1-F5-S3-T1 (per-env DNS records)
- E1-F6-S{1..5}-T2, T3 (per-env Terragrunt deploys using telemetry-api / telemetry-storage / telemetry-observability collections)
- E2-F2-S3-T1 (HMAC authorizer Lambda using collection module)
- E3-F3-S1-T1 (Managed Grafana workspace using primitive)

Once Backlog B's 14 modules are tagged on terraform-modules main, the operator runs:

```bash
WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/workspaces/rpm-migration/example-telemetry-spec \
WORKBENCH_CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-opus-4-7 \
uv run --project /workspaces/rpm-migration/workbench \
  workbench set-status E0-F4-S1-T1 done
uv run --project /workspaces/rpm-migration/workbench \
  workbench set-status E0-F4-S1 done
```

The 16 dependents auto-unblock; the orchestrator's next iteration claims them in dep-graph order.

## Multiple cross-backlog dependencies

Each external producer gets its own manual blocker. Do NOT combine unrelated external deps under one Feature. Example Telemetry currently has two:

- `E0-F3-S2-T1: External-agent placeholder -- DO NOT CLAIM` -- gates mpm-fork Tasks waiting on a mpm int-test fix being authored elsewhere.
- `E0-F4-S1-T1: Backlog B terraform-modules gate -- DO NOT CLAIM` -- gates terraform-modules-consuming Tasks waiting on Backlog B.

A given dependent Task MAY have multiple manual blockers in its Dependencies table if it consumes multiple external producers (e.g., a Task that uses both mpm and a Backlog B module). All blockers must clear before the Task is claimable.

## Authority

This document is the source of truth for cross-backlog dependency representation. `manual-blockers.md` defines the underlying idiom; this document layers on the cross-backlog usage convention.
