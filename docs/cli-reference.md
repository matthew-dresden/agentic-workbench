# Workbench CLI Reference

Complete reference for every `workbench` subcommand. Commands are grouped by purpose; within each group they are ordered by the sequence an operator or agent typically hits them.

Every command runs from the parent workspace root (the directory containing the `workbench` checkout):

```bash
uv run workbench <command> [args]
# or: python3 -m workbench <command> [args]
```

Two environment variables MUST be set before any command runs; commands that depend on them exit non-zero with a clear message when unset:

- `WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT` -- absolute path to the backlog workspace (contains `BACKLOG.md`, `backlog/`, `.workbench/`).
- `WORKBENCH_CLAUDE_MODEL` -- SDK caller's model id (example: `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7-v1`). Governs the orchestrate skill's coordination calls only. Per-agent work models live in the `agents:` block of `workbench.yaml` (see [ADR-25](adr/25-per-agent-model-overrides.md)).

Optional: `--config <path>` (or `WORKBENCH_CONFIG_PATH` env var) overrides the default `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` lookup.

## Exit codes (all commands)

- **0** -- success.
- **1** -- application-level error (invalid state, refused guard, missing work unit, bad args after parse).
- **2** -- argument-parsing error (unknown flag, missing required positional).

Commands that run a blocking external process (git, tests, judges) propagate the process exit code through, subject to the 0/1/2 contract above.

## Backlog read

Non-mutating commands for inspecting backlog state.

### `status`

```
uv run workbench status [--detail] [--include "<tokens>"] [--exclude "<tokens>"] [--session <name>]
```

Print a summary of the backlog grouped by status. Output includes counts per lifecycle value (draft, in-queue, in-progress, in-review, done, blocked, proposed, declined, hold) plus an always-rendered `Un-materialised` count of proposal JSONs pending materialisation. Also lists active and blocked work units by ID.

The summary includes a `Draft N` row rendered between the `TOTAL` line and the `In Queue` line when any work units have `draft` status. Draft work units are not eligible for autonomous claim until promoted to `in-queue` via `workbench promote`.

**Scope filter flags:**

- `--include "<tokens>"` -- one-off include selector using printer-pages syntax. Overrides any active `scope.json` when supplied. Accepts comma-separated tokens (single IDs or last-segment ranges). See [Scope selectors](#scope-selectors-printer-pages-syntax) for the full syntax reference.
- `--exclude "<tokens>"` -- one-off exclude selector. Subtracts the matched IDs from the include set. Applied after include expansion.

**Named-session filter flag:**

- `--session <name>` -- filter the output to the work units claimed by the named session. Only events emitted under `session=<name>` are counted; the status counts and active-task list reflect that session's view only. Without `--session`, the command aggregates across all active sessions and renders the unified backlog state. See [Named sessions](#named-sessions) for the full session reference.

When neither flag is supplied, `workbench status` consults the active `<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json` (if present) and applies its filter automatically. When a scope is active -- whether from flags or from `scope.json` -- a `SCOPE:` banner is printed above the Status Summary:

```
SCOPE: include=[E1-E3, E5] exclude=[] (started 2026-05-14T13:42Z)
```

The banner names the raw include / exclude token lists and the timestamp from `scope.json` (or omits the timestamp for one-off `--include` invocations). When no scope is active the banner is suppressed entirely.

Pass `--detail` (E220) to additionally render three panels at the bottom of the output:

- **In-queue tasks (with dep status):** every Task currently in `in-queue`, marked `[ready]` if every dependency is terminal or `[waiting]` with the offending blocker ID otherwise.
- **Blocked tasks (with markers / blockers):** every Task currently in `blocked`, with the first `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL] <id>` marker found in its Comments and the first non-terminal dep ID; either may be empty when the block is from a different cause (manual block, review fail).
- **Held tasks (with most recent [HOLD] reason):** every Task currently on `hold`, with the latest `[HOLD] <reason>` line from its Comments.

Without `--detail` the panels are omitted (default invocation matches the historical output shape).

The summary's `Blocked` row is split into three lines (Part-1, post-issue-#118):

- `Blocked (auto)` -- ADR-07 cascade-clearing: the task carries a `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]` marker chain that will resolve when its target tasks reach terminal.
- `Blocked (recovery)` -- AWAITING_AUTO_RECOVERY: no marker yet, but workbench's recovery loop has an artefact on disk (a pending proposal JSON, a rejected-amendment archive, or a recent recovery-agent `[BLOCKED]` audit comment within `WORKBENCH_BLOCKED_RECOVERY_WINDOW_SECONDS` -- default 1800s / 30min). The orchestrator's next sweep cycle will advance the task into the auto-clearing bucket. Operator does nothing.
- `Blocked (attn)` -- the true halt list: manual gates (`DO NOT CLAIM`), unknown marker targets, cascade-stuck states. Operator must act.

**Drain banner (issue #188):** when a `drain.signal` file is present in `<workspace>/.workbench/`, `workbench status` prepends a one-line banner above the Status Summary:

```
DRAIN REQUESTED: at 2026-05-14T13:55:01Z by matt (reason: nightly cutover)
```

The banner names the requester, the UTC timestamp, and the reason (or `(none)` when no reason was supplied). When no drain marker is present the banner is suppressed. See [`### drain`](#drain-graceful-orchestrator-stop) for the full drain subcommand reference.

### `next`

```
uv run workbench next [--include "<tokens>"] [--exclude "<tokens>"]
```

Print the next actionable work unit as JSON. Returns `ALL_DONE` when every unit is done and `NO_ACTIONABLE` when something is blocked or in-progress but nothing is ready to start. Used by the orchestrate SKILL to drive the main loop.

**Scope filter flags:** `--include` and `--exclude` accept the same printer-pages-style tokens as `status` and `start`. One-off flags override any active `scope.json`; when neither flag is supplied, the active `scope.json` (if present) is consulted automatically. When a scope is active, only work units within the scope's `expanded_ids` set are eligible candidates. See [Scope selectors](#scope-selectors-printer-pages-syntax) for the token syntax.

### `report`

```
uv run workbench report [--once|--no-stream] [--since <ISO-8601>] [--watch N] [--include "<tokens>"] [--exclude "<tokens>"] [--session <name>] [--by-role]
```

**Scope filter flags:** `--include` and `--exclude` accept the same printer-pages-style tokens as `status`, `next`, and `start`. One-off flags override any active `scope.json`; when neither flag is supplied, the active `scope.json` (if present) is consulted automatically. When a scope is active, only work units within the scope's `expanded_ids` set are counted in the per-epic Status Summary table. See [Scope selectors](#scope-selectors-printer-pages-syntax) for the token syntax.

**Named-session filter flag:** `--session <name>` restricts the report to the work units and log events associated with the named session. The per-epic Status Summary, velocity, and cost panels reflect that session's activity only. Without `--session`, the command aggregates across all active sessions -- equivalent to the pre-session single-session behaviour and the default for new workspaces. See [Named sessions](#named-sessions) for the full session reference.

Print the progress report with velocity, token consumption, and estimated cost. Default layout renders two side-by-side tables: **All-time** (full log) and **Current run** (most recent contiguous block of orchestration events, boundary detected as a gap over 10 minutes between consecutive `Set X to ...` log lines).

The Status Summary per-epic table (also written to `BACKLOG.md` by `validate-backlog`) includes a `Draft` column alongside the existing status columns. The column count reflects the number of draft-status work units under each epic. Epics with no draft work units show `0` in the `Draft` column.

**Issue #163: streaming default on TTY.** `workbench report` (no flags) opens an always-on streaming view that polls cache stats every ~100ms and re-renders the report whenever any source file advances. The screen never goes blank between refreshes -- the new frame is rendered to memory first, then emitted with the clear sequence in a single buffered write so the terminal flips OLD frame -> NEW frame in one redraw cycle. Ctrl+C exits cleanly. A `[refresh] cold X.Xs / warm Y.YYs / last refresh Z.ZZs` footer at the bottom of every frame exposes the loop's pace.

**Required environment variables (issue #221 B7):** every `workbench` subcommand -- including `report` -- requires both `WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT` and `WORKBENCH_CLAUDE_MODEL` to be set before invocation. The check fires at module-import time (`src/workbench/config.py::_require_env`); when either variable is missing workbench prints a single actionable line to stderr (`workbench: WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT environment variable is not set. Set it to the absolute path of your workspace root.`) and exits with code 2. Before the issue #221 B7 fix this path raised a Python traceback to stderr instead, which stdout-only consumers (`workbench report > out.txt`) saw as "rc=0, empty output" -- the symptom that the issue is filed against. The current behaviour is fail-fast (CLAUDE.md): non-zero exit, no traceback, no silent fallback.

- `--once` (alias `--no-stream`) -- forces the legacy one-shot snapshot, suitable for scripts and CI consumers that pipe the output. Auto-engaged when stdout is not a TTY (pipe / file redirect / CI).
- `--since <ISO-8601>` -- renders a single custom-window table and exits one-shot. A frozen-window snapshot doesn't benefit from streaming.
- `--watch N` -- *deprecated.* Kept for backward compatibility; emits a one-line deprecation notice and falls through to the streaming loop. The integer interval is ignored (cadence is data-driven).
- `--by-role` (issue #206) -- opt-in per-role token/cost breakdown panel rendered beneath the aggregate Cost section. Default OFF; without the flag the output is unchanged from the pre-#206 layout. The panel groups every transcript message by `attributionAgent` (executor, code_review, test_review, doc_review, changes_manifest, security_review, blocker_resolver, manifest_amender, task_factory, orchestrator) and prints input/output/cache-read/cache-write tokens, message count, and est_cost per role. The TOTAL row is asserted equal to the sum of the per-role rows at render time. Example output:

  ```
  Per-role cost breakdown (current run):
  role                  input_tokens  output_tokens  cache_read  cache_write  msgs   est_cost
  executor                   500,000        100,000           0            0    47    $5.0000
  code_review                200,000         40,000           0            0    18    $2.0000
  TOTAL                      700,000        140,000           0            0    65    $7.0000
  ```

  Per-role and per-model (issue #223) are orthogonal axes; the per-model rate table in `report.models` prices each row's tokens at the model that actually produced them.

Cost is computed per call, per token type, from real `usage` data. See [model-pricing.md](model-pricing.md) for the cost formula, per-model rates, and cache-multiplier env vars.

**Log-file resolution (fail-fast, no fallbacks):** `workbench report` reads its log file in this order. The same chain is used by the orchestrator's `setup_logging` writer, so both reader and writer always resolve to the same path:

1. `WORKBENCH_LOG_FILE` environment variable -- explicit override; the caller takes responsibility. Wins over everything below; useful for ad-hoc redirects and tests.
2. `log_file:` in the workspace's `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` (top-level field) -- the **single source of truth** for ordinary launches. Resolved relative to `WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT` when not absolute. Both the orchestrator (writer) and `workbench report` / `workbench hook-tail` (readers) consult this field, so coordinating shell envs across panes is no longer required.
3. `<WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT>/logs/orchestrator.log` -- the canonical per-workspace default applied when neither (1) nor (2) is set.

When NONE of (1)/(2)/(3) yields a path -- i.e. `WORKBENCH_LOG_FILE` unset, `log_file:` absent from yaml, AND `WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT` unset -- `workbench report` exits 1 with an actionable error naming all three sources. The previous implementation silently fell back to the workbench source-tree's log (`<workbench>/src/workbench/logs/orchestrator.log`), which let operators read a stale, unrelated log without noticing -- the BACKLOG.md done count and the log-derived throughput count then diverged silently.

**Divergence WARNING:** when `BACKLOG.md` reports a non-zero "Tasks completed" count but the All-time throughput window finds zero `Set <id> to 'done'` events, the report emits a one-line WARNING above the trailing summary. The two counts MUST agree on a healthy backlog (the throughput row narrates the events that produced the backlog state). A divergence almost always means `workbench report` is reading a different log than the orchestrator writes to. The warning names the log file path so the operator can immediately identify the mismatch and either set `WORKBENCH_LOG_FILE` correctly or invoke `workbench report` from the same env the orchestrator was launched with.

**Blocked-task classification (Part-1, post-issue-#118):** the report renders blocked tasks across three panels, ordered by what the operator should do:

- `Blocked tasks (auto-clearing via proposal)` -- the ADR-07 cascade will fire when every `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]` marker target reaches terminal. Each row names the IDs the task is waiting on. Operator does nothing.
- `Blocked tasks (auto-recovery in flight)` -- no marker yet, but workbench's recovery loop has an artefact on disk: a pending proposal JSON, a rejected-amendment archive, or a recent recovery-agent `[BLOCKED]` audit comment within `WORKBENCH_BLOCKED_RECOVERY_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 1800s). Each row carries a `[recovery: <signal-source>]` annotation so the operator can see which signal drove the classification. Operator does nothing for now -- the next sweep cycle will advance the task into the auto-clearing bucket.
- `Blocked tasks (needs operator attention)` -- the true halt list: manual gates (`DO NOT CLAIM`), unknown marker targets, cascade-stuck states. Each row carries just ID + title; the operator opens the work-unit file to read the blocker comment.

Empty panels are omitted entirely. The recency-window override (`WORKBENCH_BLOCKED_RECOVERY_WINDOW_SECONDS=<seconds>`) lets operators with slower iteration cadences extend the audit-comment window.

**ETA formula (issue #157):** the `Est. time to complete remaining` cell now multiplies the recent-pace minutes by `tasks_active + tasks_blocked_recovery + tasks_blocked_auto`. Both blocked buckets resolve on workbench's own (proposal cascade or auto-recovery loop), so excluding them produced an unrealistically optimistic ETA. The `needs operator attention` bucket stays excluded -- those are genuine halts with unbounded ETA. The cell carries a comment-suffix naming the bucket counts and pace, e.g. `~5.4 h (active 4 + blocked-recovery 60 + blocked-auto 27 at 5.6 min/task)`. The cost projection uses the same denominator. ETA falls back to `n/a` when fewer than the required pace samples have completed in the recent window (the metric is fragile and a single completion would project meaningless numbers).

**In-progress duration (issue #158):** the `In-progress tasks:` panel suffixes every row with a humanized attempt duration (`23m`, `1h 47m`, `2d 3h`). Multiple in-progress transitions for the same task (blocked-then-resumed) resolve to the most recent one. When neither the structured log nor the work-unit's audit comments yield a parseable timestamp the row renders `(in-progress, timer unavailable)` -- never silently omitted. The same suffix appears on `workbench status` and `workbench status --detail` Active rows.

**Orchestrator-alive banner (issue #161):** the very first line of `workbench report` is a one-line liveness banner derived from log-activity recency. Three states:

- `[ORCHESTRATOR ALIVE]` (green) -- last log line is within `stop_hook.window_seconds`. Suffix names the elapsed-since duration (`last activity 12s ago`).
- `[ORCHESTRATOR STOPPED]` (red) -- last log line older than `stop_hook.window_seconds`. Suffix names elapsed-since plus the last-seen UTC timestamp so the operator can see when the loop went quiet (`no activity for 14m (last seen 2026-05-04 13:21 UTC)`).
- `[ORCHESTRATOR STARTING]` (yellow) -- log file missing or empty. The orchestrator is starting up or no events have been written yet.

Every banner ends with the active session id when `WORKBENCH_ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION_ID` is set (`-- session backlog-a-orchestrator`); the suffix is suppressed when the env var is unset so multi-session operators never see a `-- session None` artefact.

ANSI colour is emitted only when stdout is a TTY and `NO_COLOR` is unset (mirrors the existing colour rules elsewhere in the report). When piped to `cat`, redirected to a file, or running in CI, the banner renders as plain text.

Refreshes on every `--watch N` tick alongside the rest of the table -- no separate clear sequence, so no flicker.

The threshold reuses the existing `stop_hook.window_seconds` knob (default 180s). This intentionally couples the banner's idea of "orchestrator quiet" with the circuit-breaker's, so an operator who tuned the stop-hook window to tolerate long terraform-apply / smoke-test stretches will not see the banner flash STOPPED during those quiet windows. There is no separate liveness-threshold env var or YAML field; if a future use case needs banner cadence to differ from circuit-breaker cadence, file an issue to decouple them.

### `watch`

```
uv run workbench watch [--watch N]
```

Read-only one-screen live dashboard of the currently-active orchestration: mode, active task, phase, latest agent thinking, recent tool calls, repo state, pending amendment. `--watch N` refreshes every N seconds. See [watch-activity.md](watch-activity.md) for panel details.

### `hook-tail`

```
uv run workbench hook-tail [<path>] [--tz <zone>] [--no-follow] [--from-start]
                          [--orchestrator-only | --orchestrator-session <id>]
```

Read-only pretty-tail of the plugin hook event stream (`hook-logs.jsonl`). One-line colourised summary per PreToolUse / PostToolUse / SubagentStart / SubagentStop / Stop event. Complements `watch`: where `watch` shows current state, `hook-tail` shows events as they happen.

- `<path>` defaults to `$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/hook-logs.jsonl`.
- `--tz <zone>` overrides the display timezone (any IANA zone, for example `America/Denver`). When `--tz` is absent, `hook-tail` falls back to the top-level `display_timezone:` yaml key (or `WORKBENCH_DISPLAY_TIMEZONE` env), then to OS local. Internal storage stays in UTC.
- `--no-follow` exits after emitting existing events instead of tailing.
- `--from-start` emits every event from the beginning of the file before entering follow mode.
- `--orchestrator-only` (Phase 11 / E230) filters the stream to events whose `orchestrator_session` field equals `$WORKBENCH_ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION_ID`. When the env var is unset the command exits 2 with an actionable error -- pass `--orchestrator-session <id>` instead to supply the value explicitly.
- `--orchestrator-session <id>` filters by an explicit session id (audit / replay use case). Pre-Phase-11 log entries that lack the field are passed through unfiltered so historical events stay visible.

The launch command in `example-telemetry-spec/workbench-launch-commands.txt` sets `WORKBENCH_ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION_ID` on both the orchestrator pane (so the plugin's `hook-logger.sh` stamps every event) and the hook-tail pane (so the filter has a value to match). Side-pane Claude sessions started ad-hoc inherit the workspace root but NOT the session id, so their tool calls land in the log with an empty `orchestrator_session` and are dropped by the filter -- a `tail -f hook-logs.jsonl` would still see them, but the pretty-printed orchestrator pane stays clean.

See [hook-activity.md](hook-activity.md) for the event glyphs and the full column legend.

### `watchdog`

```
uv run workbench watchdog [--idle-minutes N] [--flag-file PATH] [--log-file PATH] [--print-if-stuck]
```

Single-shot poll that detects a stuck `/workbench:orchestrate` loop and writes a marker file the operator can surface in their shell prompt. Exits 0 always -- it is a checker, not a daemon.

A run is considered stuck when **both** conditions hold:

1. `BACKLOG.md` contains at least one row with `Status: in-progress`.
2. The most recent dated line in the orchestrator log is older than `--idle-minutes` (default 5). Path resolution mirrors `workbench report` -- (1) `WORKBENCH_LOG_FILE`, (2) `log_file:` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`, (3) `<WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT>/logs/orchestrator.log`.

On stuck detection the marker file is written with:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-04-22T21:00:00Z",
  "task_id": "E1-F2-S26-T3",
  "task_file_path": "backlog/E1/E1-F2/E1-F2-S26/E1-F2-S26-T3.md",
  "orchestrator_idle_seconds": 600,
  "last_orchestrator_log_ts": "2026-04-22T20:08:01Z",
  "idle_threshold_seconds": 300,
  "stale_task_minutes_threshold": 120
}
```

Flags:

- `--idle-minutes N` -- override the idle threshold (default 5; minimum 1).
- `--flag-file PATH` -- override the marker path (default `$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/needs-restart.flag`).
- `--log-file PATH` -- override the orchestrator log location. Default is the workbench repo's `src/workbench/logs/orchestrator.log` relative to the installed package; pass an explicit path (or set `WORKBENCH_LOG_FILE` and read `$WORKBENCH_LOG_FILE`) to point watchdog at the same workspace-local log the orchestrator wrote to. `cmd_watchdog` does NOT consult the `log_file:` yaml field today; pass `--log-file` (or wrap with the env) to keep the writer/reader in sync.
- `--print-if-stuck` -- print a one-line `[workbench watchdog] STUCK: <id> (idle Ns, threshold Mm)` status to stdout on detection. Silent when healthy so it pipes cleanly in `PROMPT_COMMAND`.

Typical operator integrations:

```bash
# Shell prompt nag (add to ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc):
PROMPT_COMMAND="uv run workbench watchdog --print-if-stuck; $PROMPT_COMMAND"

# Terminal watcher in a second pane:
watch -n 60 'uv run workbench watchdog --print-if-stuck'

# Cron-style polling (no follow loop -- one-shot):
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/workspace && uv run workbench watchdog
```

The watchdog never attempts to restart orchestration itself. Restarts remain under operator control because they may overlap with manual edits and affect billing.

### `cost-calibrate`

```
uv run workbench cost-calibrate <actual-usd> [--window <ISO-8601>]
```

Issue #223: calibrate per-model correction factors against an actual Anthropic invoice. Sums workbench's reported cost across every model observed in the window, derives `correction_factor = actual_usd / reported_total`, and writes the factor back to `report.models.<id>.correction_factor` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` for every model that contributed. The next `workbench report` reflects the corrected total without further operator action.

- `<actual-usd>` -- required; the operator's actual spend in USD for the window (typically taken from an Anthropic invoice line). Must be > 0.
- `--window <ISO-8601>` -- optional; restricts the calibration window to events at or after the given timestamp. Defaults to `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` (every event in the cache).

Exit codes:

- `0` on success (file written, summary printed).
- `1` when the selected window's reported cost is `$0.00` (no billable activity yet -- widen the window or run after a real session).
- `2` on argument validation errors or missing `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`.

Successive calibrations replace (not multiply) the prior `correction_factor` so re-running with the same actual-spend figure is idempotent. See [model-pricing.md](model-pricing.md) for the full calibration workflow.

### `list-proposals`

```
uv run workbench list-proposals
```

Print every pending task-factory proposal with a per-task `[state]` label: `[unmaterialised]`, `[proposed]`, `[promoted]`, `[done]`, `[declined]`, `[rejected]`. Used by the orchestrator and by operators triaging proposed drafts. See [task-factory.md](task-factory.md).

### `validate-backlog`

```
uv run workbench validate-backlog
```

Integrity check across the full backlog: file existence, status sync between BACKLOG.md and work-unit files, orphaned files, invalid dependency references, Status Summary table count accuracy, content-rule violations, and Changes Manifest path-prefix violations (reject any manifest entry that begins with a `<checkout_directory>/` prefix; see [backlog-contract.md](backlog-contract.md) for the path-prefix rule). Exits 1 and prints every finding when any violation is found.

Additional rules enforced as part of the Backlog A lessons-learned tooling (see [backlog-author-discovery.md](backlog-author-discovery.md) and [source-test-atomicity.md](source-test-atomicity.md)):

- **Manifest Conflict Rule**: two in-queue tasks targeting the same `(repo, file)` ownership without an explicit dependency ordering between them are rejected. Wire a dependency via `workbench add-dep <later> <earlier>` or reassign ownership.
- **Language-AC Alignment Rule**: AC-FINAL Python-tooling lines (002-005, 008, 014) on non-Python tasks (HCL/YAML/JSON-only Manifests) must end with the `-- N/A for <tier> Tasks (no Python source authored)` suffix.
- **Source-Test Atomicity Rule**: every production Python source file in a Manifest (under `src/`, `infra/scripts/`, or `services/<name>/src/`) must have a matching `test_<basename>.py` entry in the SAME Manifest. Splitting source/test across sibling tasks blocks AC-FINAL-014 coverage at task close.

Invoked automatically at orchestrator startup; operators should run it after hand-edits.

### `write-snapshot`

```
uv run workbench write-snapshot
```

Render the report once and persist it to `<workspace>/.workbench/report-snapshot.json`. Used by the orchestrate skill at the end of every loop iteration so subsequent `workbench report --once` calls serve from the snapshot quickly (file read + print only, skipping log parse and aggregation). Idempotent. ADR-20.

### `rebuild-window-stats`

```
uv run workbench rebuild-window-stats
```

Walks the orchestrator log and rebuilds every per-task aggregate JSON under `<workspace>/.workbench/window-stats/`. Idempotent; safe to run at any cadence. Use after manually deleting `.workbench/window-stats/` or when window-stats files appear out of sync with the log. ADR-17.

### `archive-session`

```
uv run workbench archive-session <session-id> [--log-path <path>]
```

Convert an ended session's JSONL log to a Parquet cold archive at `<workspace>/logs/legacy/<session-id>.parquet`. **Opt-in** via `pip install agentic-workbench[archive]`; raises `ArchiveDependencyMissing` with the install command when `pyarrow` isn't installed. Per-session; operator-driven. ADR-21.

### `check`

```
uv run workbench check
```

Pre-flight verifier for orchestrator launch readiness. For every repo in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`'s `repos:` map, confirms (1) symlink at `$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/<checkout_directory>` exists, (2) the local clone has an `origin` remote, (3) the remote's `default_branch` matches `workbench.yaml` (when set), and (4) no open PR already targets `git_ops.single_branch` (when single-branch mode is on). Exits 0 when every repo passes; exits 1 with one actionable error per failure otherwise. The `gh api` / `gh pr list` calls use the timeout in `WORKBENCH_CHECK_GH_API_TIMEOUT` (seconds, default `30`).

Under `git_ops.local_only: true`, the origin check inverts: the local clone MUST NOT have an `origin` remote (presence is a misconfiguration). Checks (3) and (4) are skipped because there is no remote to query through `gh`.

### `read-unit`

```
uv run workbench read-unit [--strip-comments] <id>
```

Print the work-unit content (the `.md` file body) plus the resolved repo path as JSON. Used by agents to fetch work-unit context for their prompts. `--strip-comments` omits the `## Comments` audit history, useful for first-round review agents that do not need prior feedback context.

Mutating commands on the backlog itself. All writes go through the workflow gates; operators use these commands directly only for recovery or lifecycle transitions that the orchestrator does not drive.

### `claim`

```
uv run workbench claim <id>
```

Set the work unit's status to `in-progress`. Fails if the unit is already in a terminal state. Invoked by the orchestrate SKILL at the start of each loop iteration.

### `set-status`

```
uv run workbench set-status <id> <status>
uv run workbench set-status --include "<tokens>" [--exclude "<tokens>"] [--dry-run] [--yes] <new_status>
```

Force any status on a work unit. Skips the done-gate and other workflow checks. Used for recovery (unblock a stuck unit, resurrect a declined unit) and for orchestrator-internal lifecycle transitions. Accepted values: `draft`, `in-queue`, `in-progress`, `in-review`, `done`, `blocked`, `proposed`, `declined`, `hold`.

Note: to transition `draft -> in-queue` on one or more units, prefer `workbench promote` (which validates the source status and writes the `[PROMOTED] draft -> in-queue` audit comment). Use `set-status draft` only for ad-hoc recovery or for setting a new work unit's initial state when the default-status config is not sufficient.

**Range variant (bulk updates):**

The range variant accepts printer-pages-style selector tokens (the same syntax used by `workbench start --include` and `workbench scope set`) and applies the requested status to every matched work unit in a single atomic transaction:

- `--include "<tokens>"` -- printer-pages selector for the target work units. Accepts comma-separated tokens: single IDs (`E1-F2-S3-T4`), last-segment ranges (`E2-F1-S1-T3-T7`), epic/feature/story shorthands (`E1`, `E2-F1`, `E2-F1-S1`). See [Scope selectors](#scope-selectors-printer-pages-syntax) for the full token syntax.
- `--exclude "<tokens>"` -- subtract the matched IDs from the include set. Applied after include expansion.
- `--dry-run` -- enumerate the matched work units and the target status without writing any changes. Prints one line per matched unit and a summary count. Exits rc=0.
- `--yes` -- skip the interactive confirmation prompt. By default, `set-status` prompts for confirmation when the expanded set exceeds `bulk_update_confirm_threshold` (default: 10, configurable in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`). Pass `--yes` to bypass the prompt in automation / CI.

All writes acquire the `BACKLOG.lock` flock once before iterating matched units, so the operation is atomic -- concurrent orchestrators see either all updates or none. Each per-unit write goes through `BacklogManager._set_status` so audit logic and rollup logic continue to fire. A workspace-level `[BULK_STATUS_UPDATE] <count> WUs set to '<status>' by --include="..." --exclude="..."` audit row is appended to the path declared in `bulk_update_audit_path` (default: `logs/bulk-updates.log`) after every successful bulk invocation.

**BacklogConfig keys consumed by the range variant:**

```yaml
backlog:
  bulk_update_confirm_threshold: 10           # prompt when expansion > N (default 10)
  bulk_update_audit_path: logs/bulk-updates.log   # workspace-relative audit log path
```

**Worked examples:**

```bash
# Promote all units in epic E1 to in-queue (release for autonomous work):
uv run workbench set-status --include "E1" in-queue
# -> prompts for confirmation if expansion > bulk_update_confirm_threshold
# -> [BULK_STATUS_UPDATE] 42 WUs set to 'in-queue' by --include="E1" --exclude=""

# Hold all units in epic E5 (pause while scope is reconsidered):
uv run workbench set-status --include "E5" hold
# -> [BULK_STATUS_UPDATE] 37 WUs set to 'hold' by --include="E5" --exclude=""

# Decline a range of tasks E2-F1-S1 T3 through T7:
uv run workbench set-status --include "E2-F1-S1-T3-T7" declined
# -> [BULK_STATUS_UPDATE] 5 WUs set to 'declined' by --include="E2-F1-S1-T3-T7" --exclude=""

# Preview which units would be affected without writing (--dry-run):
uv run workbench set-status --include "E3" --dry-run in-queue
# -> DRY RUN: 18 WUs would be set to 'in-queue':
#      E3-F1-S1-T1  (draft)
#      E3-F1-S1-T2  (draft)
#      ...
#    No changes written.

# Skip the confirmation prompt for large expansions (CI / automation):
uv run workbench set-status --include "E1-E4" --yes in-queue
# -> [BULK_STATUS_UPDATE] 163 WUs set to 'in-queue' by --include="E1-E4" --exclude="" (no prompt)

# Promote epic E2 but exclude a sub-tree already done:
uv run workbench set-status --include "E2" --exclude "E2-F3" in-queue
# -> [BULK_STATUS_UPDATE] 29 WUs set to 'in-queue' by --include="E2" --exclude="E2-F3"
```

**Exit codes:**

| Command | rc=0 | rc!=0 |
|---------|------|-------|
| `set-status <id> <status>` | Status written. | rc=1 when ID not found or status value unrecognised. |
| `set-status --include ... <status>` | All matched units written. | rc=1 when no units match, status value unrecognised, or reversed range token detected. |
| `set-status --include ... --dry-run <status>` | Preview printed; no write. | rc=1 on invalid selector syntax. |
| `set-status --include ... --yes <status>` | All matched units written (no prompt). | rc=1 on selector / status errors. |

### `mark-done`

```
uv run workbench mark-done <id>
```

Mark the unit as `done`. Enforces the done-gate: all four review judges (`code_review`, `test_review`, `doc_review`, `changes_manifest`) must have logged `[REVIEW_PASS]` in the most recent round (after any intervening `[REVIEW_REJECTED]`). Security review must also have passed. Exits 1 with a clear error naming the missing judge(s) when the gate fails.

### `decline`

```
uv run workbench decline <id> --reason "<message>"
```

Mark a work unit `declined`: it will never be done. Used when the operator decides the unit's scope is being removed, the functionality is being deleted instead, or a different task delivered the same outcome. Declined children count as terminal-complete for parent rollup. See [ADR-05](adr/05-declined-status.md).

### `hold`

```
uv run workbench hold <id> --reason "<message>"
```

Mark a work unit `hold`: it is intentionally deferred (under debate, awaiting external decision, scope being re-discussed). Held units are skipped by the orchestrator's `next`/parallel-candidate scan until an operator runs `unhold`. Unlike `declined`, `hold` is **not** terminal -- a held child keeps its parent open and uncounted toward auto-rollup. The `--reason` is REQUIRED so the deferral leaves an audit trail in the work-unit's Comments section (`[HOLD] <reason>`); em-dashes in the reason text are rejected at the input boundary. Multi-token reasons survive the dispatcher (the command is registered as variadic) so `--reason "needs product input on scope"` works without quoting tricks.

### `unhold`

```
uv run workbench unhold <id> --reason "<message>"
```

Return a held work unit to `in-queue`. Refuses any unit whose current status is anything other than `hold` (fail-fast keeps the lifecycle linear -- use `set-status` for ad-hoc transitions). The `--reason` is REQUIRED and captured as `[UNHOLD] <reason>` in the Comments section, so a hold-then-unhold round-trip is fully reconstructible from the audit trail.

### `promote`

```
uv run workbench promote <id>
uv run workbench promote --epic <id>
uv run workbench promote --feature <id>
uv run workbench promote --story <id>
uv run workbench promote --all [--yes]
```

Transition one or more work units from `draft -> in-queue`, making them eligible for autonomous claim. Each promoted work unit receives a `[PROMOTED] draft -> in-queue` audit comment in its `## Comments` section.

Refuses (rc=1) any work unit that is not currently in `draft` status -- use `set-status` for ad-hoc transitions between other statuses.

**Selector variants:**

- `workbench promote <id>` -- promote a single work unit by its ID (e.g. `E1-F2-S3-T4`). Exits 1 with an actionable error if the unit is not currently in `draft`.
- `workbench promote --epic <id>` -- promote every work unit under the named epic in one transaction (e.g. `workbench promote --epic E1`). All descendants must be in `draft` status; the entire transaction aborts with rc=1 if any descendant is not in `draft`.
- `workbench promote --feature <id>` -- promote every work unit under the named feature (e.g. `workbench promote --feature E1-F2`). All descendants must be in `draft` status; the entire transaction aborts with rc=1 if any descendant is not in `draft`.
- `workbench promote --story <id>` -- promote every work unit under the named story (e.g. `workbench promote --story E1-F2-S3`). All descendants must be in `draft` status; the entire transaction aborts with rc=1 if any descendant is not in `draft`.
- `workbench promote --all` -- promote every `draft`-status work unit in the entire backlog. Prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` is also passed.
- `workbench promote --all --yes` -- skip the confirmation prompt and promote all draft work units immediately. Safe for automation / CI.

**Example -- single unit:**

```bash
uv run workbench promote E1-F2-S3-T4
# -> [PROMOTED] draft -> in-queue appended to E1-F2-S3-T4.md
```

**Example -- bulk by epic:**

```bash
uv run workbench promote --epic E5
# -> all draft WUs under E5 promoted to in-queue in one pass
```

**Example -- all drafts with confirmation bypass:**

```bash
uv run workbench promote --all --yes
# -> every draft WU in the backlog promoted; no interactive prompt
```

Implementation detail: `promote` delegates to `BacklogManager.force_status` per unit and appends the audit comment via `BacklogManager._append_agent_comment`. No new status-transition logic is introduced; the command is a thin operator-facing wrapper that validates the pre-condition (`draft`) and iterates the selected scope.

### `new-task`

```
uv run workbench new-task --id <ID> --title "<TITLE>" --target <PATH>
                         [--repo <ORG/REPO>]
                         [--description <TEXT>]
                         [--source-file <PATH>]
                         [--test-file <PATH>]
                         [--ac-func <TEXT>]
```

Scaffold a new work-unit `.md` file from the canonical template. Required flags: `--id`, `--title`, `--target`. The template kind is derived from the ID's last segment: `T` -> task, `S` -> story, `F` -> feature, `E` -> epic; an unrecognised shape exits 1 with an actionable error. The command refuses to overwrite an existing `--target` and refuses a `--target` whose parent directory is missing -- create the directory first or pick a different path.

Optional flags fill `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders in the template. Tokens with no flag get a deterministic default (e.g. `--source-file` -> `src/<repo-name>/<id-lower>.py`, `--test-file` -> `tests/unit/test_<source-stem>.py`, `--ac-func` -> `"TBD: describe the functional outcome."`). The `--repo` flag also drives the `## Target Repository` section's `**Repo:**` line.

Templates ship under `backlog/templates/{epic,feature,story,task}.md` in the workbench repo and cross-link to `docs/acceptance-criteria-canonical.md` and `docs/source-test-atomicity.md` for authoring rules.

### `sync-blocked`

```
uv run workbench sync-blocked
```

Reconcile every task's status against current dependency satisfaction. Walks the parsed index and:

- **in-queue to blocked** (forward direction): flips `in-queue` Tasks whose dependencies are NOT satisfied to `blocked` (with a `[BLOCKED] sync-blocked: dependency '<id>' not yet terminal` audit comment naming the first offending dep).
- **blocked to in-queue** (reverse direction): flips `blocked` Tasks whose dependencies are now satisfied (every dep -- including epic / feature / story-level deps that recurse into descendants -- is `done` or `declined`) back to `in-queue` (with a `[UNBLOCKED] sync-blocked: dependencies now terminal` audit comment).

`sync-blocked` is **bidirectional**: it both blocks tasks whose deps are unmet and unblocks tasks whose deps are now satisfied. It operates on regular Dependencies-table rows only. The separate auto-unblock cascade for `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]` markers fires automatically from `mark_done` via `_auto_requeue_marker_dependents` in `BacklogManager` -- that cascade triggers whenever the newly-done task is referenced either as a declared dependency OR as a `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]` marker ID in the Comments section (issue #200 / AC-200-2).

Tasks whose status is anything other than `in-queue` or `blocked` (e.g. `in-progress`, `in-review`, `done`, `declined`, `hold`, `proposed`) are untouched by `sync-blocked`. Output is a JSON envelope of the form `{"flipped_to_blocked": [...], "flipped_to_in_queue": [...]}` for scripting.

Useful as a pre-flight sweep before `workbench next` (after manual edits to the backlog) and for triage when a backlog has drifted out of sync. Combine with `validate-backlog` for a complete consistency check.

### `scope`

```
uv run workbench scope set --include "<tokens>" [--exclude "<tokens>"]
uv run workbench scope clear
uv run workbench scope show
```

Persistent scope management without starting the orchestrator (spec section 4.2.6, issue #196). Writes, clears, or displays the active `<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json`. Useful for pre-arming a scope before launching interactive Claude Code so the orchestrate skill respects the filter without the operator having to launch and kill `workbench start` first.

**Subcommands:**

- **`scope set --include "<tokens>" [--exclude "<tokens>"]`** -- parse the printer-pages tokens, validate them against the current `BACKLOG.md`, and write `<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json` atomically (temp-then-rename). Out-of-range tokens emit a warning but do not fail (rc=0). The written `scope.json` is byte-identical to the one `workbench start --include "..."` would write -- subsequent `workbench start` / `workbench next` / `workbench status` / `workbench report` invocations honour it identically. Exits 0 on success; exits 1 with an actionable stderr message when a token is a reversed range or structurally malformed.

- **`scope clear`** -- delete `<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json`. Idempotent: exits 0 with the message `no scope pending` when no file is present.

- **`scope show`** -- print the active scope state (include list, exclude list, expanded ID count, `started_at`, `started_by`) or `no scope pending` when no scope file exists. Exits 0 in both cases.

**scope.json schema:**

```json
{
  "include": ["E1-E3", "E5"],
  "exclude": [],
  "expanded_ids": ["E1-F1-S1-T1", "..."],
  "started_at": "2026-05-14T13:42:11Z",
  "started_by": "matt"
}
```

The file lives at `<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json`. When `WORKBENCH_SESSION_NAME` is set (named sessions, spec section 4.4), the path is `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/<name>/scope.json` instead.

**Interactive pre-arm workflow:**

```bash
# Pre-arm scope for epics E1 through E3 plus E5
WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT=$PWD WORKBENCH_CLAUDE_MODEL=... \
  uv run workbench scope set --include "E1-E3, E5"

# Launch interactive Claude Code; the orchestrate skill respects the pre-armed scope.json
WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT=$PWD WORKBENCH_CLAUDE_MODEL=... \
  claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --plugin-dir <workbench>/plugin/workbench

# Clear when done
uv run workbench scope clear
```

See [Scope selectors](#scope-selectors-printer-pages-syntax) for the full token syntax reference. For the step-by-step interactive pre-arm workflow, see [`docs/zero-to-ready.md` -- Scoping a run interactively](zero-to-ready.md#scoping-a-run-interactively).

### `start`

```
uv run workbench start [--include "<tokens>"] [--exclude "<tokens>"] [--name <name>] [--allow-overlap]
```

Run the orchestrate SKILL non-interactively via the Agent SDK. Invoked by `make start` (the recommended way to run Workbench). Loads the plugin ad-hoc from the workbench checkout; no global `make plugin-install` required. When the workspace's `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` declares an `agents:` block (see [`docs/adr/25-per-agent-model-overrides.md`](adr/25-per-agent-model-overrides.md)), `start` materialises a workspace-local shadow plugin tree at `<workspace>/.workbench/plugin-shadow/workbench/` and passes that path to the SDK in place of the canonical plugin.

**SDK teardown warning (issue #232):** successful orchestrator runs may emit a single `WARNING` line on the `workbench.sdk` logger during session teardown that references [workbench#231](https://github.com/matthew-dresden/agentic-workbench/issues/231). This is a known upstream race in `claude-agent-sdk`'s `Query.close()` -- the orchestrator's outcome is unaffected. The filter downgrades what would otherwise be an `[asyncio] ERROR Task exception was never retrieved` trace to a single WARNING so remote execution environments that classify stderr ERROR lines as failures still see the run as successful. The workaround is removed once the upstream SDK fix lands; see workbench#231 for the tracking status and [anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python#983](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/983) for the upstream bug.

**Scope filter flags:**

- `--include "<tokens>"` -- printer-pages-style include selector. Restricts the orchestrator to the named work units and their descendants. Accepts comma-separated tokens (single IDs or last-segment ranges). See [Scope selectors](#scope-selectors-printer-pages-syntax) for the full syntax.
- `--exclude "<tokens>"` -- subtract the matched IDs from the include set. Applied after include expansion.

When `--include` is supplied, the parsed scope is persisted to `<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json` atomically (temp-then-rename) before the orchestrate SKILL starts. The scope file is deleted on clean orchestrator exit; it survives orchestrator crashes and is visible to subsequent `workbench status` / `workbench report` invocations.

When `--include` is omitted (the default), all work units are eligible -- the existing behaviour is fully preserved.

**Named-session flags:**

- `--name <name>` -- assign the orchestrator session a unique name. The session creates a per-session state directory at `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/<name>/` containing a `pid` file, `scope.json`, `drain.signal`, `orchestrator.log`, `report.json`, `started_at`, and `started_by` files. The session is registered in `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/registry.json`. When `--name` is omitted, the session defaults to `default`, preserving the single-session behaviour exactly. The session name is exported as `WORKBENCH_SESSION_NAME` for all subprocesses, which drives per-session routing of logs, drain signals, and scope files. See [Named sessions](#named-sessions) for the full lifecycle reference.

- `--allow-overlap` -- by default, `workbench start` checks active sessions for scope overlap before registering the new session. If the new session's `expanded_ids` intersects any active session's scope, the command fails fast with a clear error naming the conflicting work unit IDs and the owning session(s). Pass `--allow-overlap` to skip this check and start the session anyway; a warning is printed listing the conflicting IDs. The atomic claim arbitration (`flock(BACKLOG.lock)`) resolves the race deterministically when two sessions attempt to claim the same work unit -- only one wins. Use `--allow-overlap` only when the operator has verified that the overlapping IDs are intended (for example, two read-only reporting sessions).

**Example -- scope to epics E1 through E3 plus E5:**

```bash
uv run workbench start --include "E1-E3, E5"
```

**Example -- scope to E1-E10, excluding E5 and everything under E7-F3:**

```bash
uv run workbench start --include "E1-E10" --exclude "E5, E7-F3"
```

**Example -- launch two named sessions with disjoint scopes:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: session "alpha" works on E1 through E3
uv run workbench start --name alpha --include "E1-E3"

# Terminal 2: session "beta" works on E4 through E6
uv run workbench start --name beta --include "E4-E6"
```

To pre-arm scope.json without immediately launching the orchestrator, use `workbench scope set` instead.

### `prepare-plugin-shadow`

```
uv run workbench prepare-plugin-shadow
```

Materialise the workspace-local shadow plugin (ADR-25) without launching anything and print its absolute path to stdout. Used by interactive launchers so the same per-agent model overrides apply when an operator drives the orchestrate skill manually:

```
claude --plugin-dir "$(uv run workbench prepare-plugin-shadow)"
```

When the workspace has no `agents:` overrides configured, prints the canonical plugin path; otherwise rewrites every overridden agent `.md` and symlinks the rest. Shares its implementation with `start`'s pre-flight so the two modes always produce identical plugin trees.

The YAML schema for the override block is shown below with each field set to the **current frontmatter default**. The defaults are tuned by the role each agent plays: `executor` (writes code under TDD) on `sonnet` for a fast happy path; the five judges (`code-reviewer`, `test-reviewer`, `doc-reviewer`, `changes-manifest`, `security-reviewer`) on `opus` because a bad verdict costs more than the inference savings; `blocker-resolver`, `manifest-amender`, `task-factory` on `opus` because they fire only on unhappy paths and a wrong call spins the recovery cascade; `review-supervisor` on `sonnet` because the Agent tool used to fan out to the four reviewers needs the reliability of a mid-tier model. `haiku` is rejected at config-load for all per-agent fields (matthew-dresden/agentic-workbench#198). Setting a field to its frontmatter default value is a no-op; flip individual fields when you need to retarget an agent (e.g., drop the judges to `sonnet` when opus quota is exhausted):

```yaml
agents:
  executor: sonnet
  blocker_resolver: opus
  manifest_amender: opus
  security_reviewer: opus
  task_factory: opus
  review_supervisor: sonnet
  review_team:
    code_reviewer: opus
    test_reviewer: opus
    doc_reviewer: opus
    changes_manifest: opus
```

Every field defaults to `null` when absent (use the agent's `.md` frontmatter model). When `use_bedrock: true`, every value must be a Bedrock ARN (`us.anthropic.claude-<name>-<ver>-v<N>`); when `false`, values must be a short name (`opus`/`sonnet`) or an Anthropic API id (`claude-opus-4-7`). `haiku` is rejected at config-load time for all per-agent fields (matthew-dresden/agentic-workbench#198). `WORKBENCH_AGENT_MODEL_<NAME>` env vars (e.g. `WORKBENCH_AGENT_MODEL_EXECUTOR=opus`, `JUDGE_AGENT_MODEL_CODE_REVIEWER=opus`) override the YAML on a per-call basis (env > yaml > frontmatter).

## Drain (graceful orchestrator stop)

Operator-initiated graceful stop of a running or about-to-start orchestrator. The drain protocol lets the orchestrator finish its current work unit, then exit cleanly rather than being killed mid-task. The mechanism is a JSON signal file at `<workspace>/.workbench/drain.signal` (or `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/<name>/drain.signal` when a named session is active); the orchestrator polls the file between work units. The orchestrator's reader scans both candidate paths -- the per-session path first, then the workspace-root path as a fallback -- so a `workbench drain` issued from a shell with no `WORKBENCH_SESSION_NAME` env var is still observed by a session-scoped orchestrator (issue #212). The file is consumed (deleted) on orchestrator exit, and the `finally` clause additionally wipes any signal at either path on every exit (clean, drain-enforced, crash) so a subsequent `workbench start` never inherits a stale request. Spec source: `spec/workbench-self-improve.md` section 4.3. Issues #188 and #212.

### `drain`

```
uv run workbench drain [--reason "<text>"]
uv run workbench drain --cancel
uv run workbench drain --status
```

Request, withdraw, or inspect the drain signal. The bare form and `--reason` variant create the signal; `--cancel` removes it; `--status` is read-only and always exits rc=0.

**Variants:**

- **`workbench drain`** -- request a graceful stop with no reason. Writes `<workspace>/.workbench/drain.signal` with a JSON payload containing `requested_at` (UTC ISO 8601), `requested_by` (current `USER` / `USERNAME` env var, or `"unknown"`), and `reason` (empty string). The write is atomic (temp-then-rename) so readers never observe a partial file. Overwrites any existing signal. Exits 0 on success; filesystem failures propagate as unhandled exceptions (Python traceback to stderr).

- **`workbench drain --reason "<text>"`** -- same as the bare form, with a non-empty reason string embedded in the payload. The reason is stored verbatim and surfaced by `workbench status` and `workbench drain --status`.

- **`workbench drain --cancel`** -- withdraw the drain request. Deletes the drain signal from both the per-session path (when `WORKBENCH_SESSION_NAME` is set) and the workspace-root path so a writer at either location is cleared in one call (issue #212). Idempotent: exits 0 silently whether or not a signal file was present at either path. Cancelling while the orchestrator is mid-WU prevents the orchestrator from exiting at the next WU boundary -- it continues as if no drain was requested (AC-188-10). Filesystem failures propagate as unhandled exceptions.

- **`workbench drain --status`** -- print the current drain state and exit rc=0 in both cases:
  - Signal present: prints a one-line summary of the form `drain pending: requested_by=<user> at=<ISO-8601> reason=<reason-or-none>`.
  - No signal: prints `no drain pending`.

  The orchestrate skill calls `workbench drain --status` between Step 9 (mark-done) and Step 10 (loop back) so it can exit cleanly without a special sentinel file. rc=0 in both states lets the skill use the printed output as the discriminator rather than the exit code.

**How the orchestrator honours the drain signal:**

When the running orchestrator detects the drain signal between work units (either via the cooperative skill check or the SDK-wrapper poll in `cmd_start::_run`), it:

1. Finishes the current work unit (the WU in-progress reaches `done` or `blocked` first).
2. Consumes the signal (reads + deletes the marker file atomically from the orchestrator process's perspective).
3. Logs `[ORCHESTRATOR_DRAIN]` (cooperative skill path) or `[ORCHESTRATOR_DRAIN_ENFORCED]` (SDK-wrapper backstop) to the orchestrator log with the original reason.
4. Exits cleanly with rc=0.

The next `workbench start` runs without any drain restriction because the marker was consumed.

**Pre-arm pattern (AC-188-6):** dropping the marker BEFORE `workbench start` causes the orchestrator to claim and complete exactly one work unit, then exit. This is useful for a controlled single-step execution or for confirming a work unit runs cleanly before committing to a full unattended run.

**Exit codes:**

| Command | rc=0 | rc!=0 |
|---------|------|-------|
| `drain` | Signal written. | Filesystem failures propagate as unhandled OSError (Python traceback). |
| `drain --reason "<text>"` | Signal written. | Filesystem failures propagate as unhandled OSError (Python traceback). |
| `drain --cancel` | Signal removed or was already absent (silent, no output). | Filesystem failures propagate as unhandled OSError (Python traceback). |
| `drain --status` | Always (signal present or absent). | rc=2 on invalid argument combinations; startup errors (unset env vars) raise immediately. |

**Worked examples:**

```bash
# Request graceful stop with a reason:
uv run workbench drain --reason "nightly cutover"

# Check current drain state (rc=0 either way):
uv run workbench drain --status
# -> drain pending: requested_by=matt at=2026-05-14T13:55:01+00:00 reason=nightly cutover
# -- or --
# -> no drain pending

# Withdraw the request before the orchestrator picks it up:
uv run workbench drain --cancel
# (no output; exits rc=0 whether or not a signal was present)

# Pre-arm: drop drain before start so orchestrator runs exactly one WU then exits:
uv run workbench drain
uv run workbench start --include "E1-F2-S3-T4"
# -> orchestrator claims E1-F2-S3-T4, completes it, detects drain, exits rc=0
```

**Status banner:** when a drain signal is present, `workbench status` prepends a `DRAIN REQUESTED: at <ts> by <user> (reason: <text>)` banner above the Status Summary so the operator can see the pending drain at a glance. See the [`status`](#status) section for the full banner format.

## Named sessions

Named sessions let multiple independent orchestrator processes run concurrently against the same workspace without corrupting the shared backlog. Each session operates on a disjoint scope, writes to per-session log and drain files, and is registered in a shared `registry.json` so operators can inspect and manage running sessions. Spec source: `spec/workbench-self-improve.md` section 4.4. Issue #192. ADR-23.

Per-session state lives under `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/<name>/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pid` | The orchestrator process's PID. Used for liveness checks and SIGTERM delivery. |
| `scope.json` | Session-scoped scope filter (overrides workspace-root `scope.json`). |
| `drain.signal` | Session-scoped drain marker. Takes priority over workspace-root `drain.signal` when both exist; if the session path is empty, the reader falls through to workspace-root so an operator's `workbench drain` (no session env var) is still observed (issue #212). |
| `orchestrator.log` | Per-session log, written in addition to the aggregate `<workspace>/logs/orchestrator.log`. |
| `report.json` | Session-scoped report cache. |
| `started_at` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of session start. |
| `started_by` | OS user that launched the session (`USER` / `USERNAME` env var, or `"unknown"`). |

The `default` session name is applied implicitly when `--name` is omitted from `workbench start`; single-session operators see no behaviour change.

**[WU_CLAIMED] audit format extension (spec 4.4.7):** when `WORKBENCH_SESSION_NAME` is set (an active named session), the work-unit audit comment written at claim time extends to:

```
[WU_CLAIMED] Set <id> to 'in-progress' session=<name>
```

When `WORKBENCH_SESSION_NAME` is unset (single-session legacy behaviour), the comment format is unchanged:

```
[WU_CLAIMED] Set <id> to 'in-progress'
```

### `sessions`

```
uv run workbench sessions [--cleanup]
```

List all registered orchestrator sessions and their liveness state. Each row in the output includes: session name, PID, scope (included ID count or the raw token list), `started_at` timestamp, drain state (`pending` or `none`), and a liveness indicator (`ACTIVE` when the process is running; `STALE` when the PID is no longer alive).

- **`workbench sessions`** (no flags) -- print a table of all sessions currently in `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/registry.json`. Stale sessions are listed but not removed, so operators can review them before cleanup. Exits 0 in all cases, even when no sessions are registered (prints `no sessions registered`).

- **`workbench sessions --cleanup`** -- remove session directories whose `pid` file references a non-running process. Stale session entries are removed from `registry.json` and the corresponding `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/<name>/` directory is deleted. Active sessions are left untouched. Prints one line per removed session (`[CLEANED] session <name> (pid <N>)`). Exits 0 on success.

**Exit codes:**

| Command | rc=0 | rc!=0 |
|---------|------|-------|
| `sessions` | Success (zero or more sessions listed). | Startup errors (unset env vars) raise immediately. |
| `sessions --cleanup` | Success (zero or more stale sessions removed). | Filesystem errors propagate as unhandled OSError. |

**Worked examples:**

```bash
# List all registered sessions:
uv run workbench sessions
# Output (example):
#   NAME     PID    SCOPE        STARTED_AT              DRAIN    LIVENESS
#   alpha    12345  E1-E3 (42)   2026-05-14T13:42:00Z    none     ACTIVE
#   beta     99999  E4-E6 (37)   2026-05-14T13:50:00Z    none     STALE

# Remove stale sessions:
uv run workbench sessions --cleanup
# -> [CLEANED] session beta (pid 99999)
```

### `stop`

```
uv run workbench stop --session <name>
```

Send SIGTERM to a running session's orchestrator process, forcing it to exit after the in-flight work unit is marked `blocked`. The SIGTERM is delivered via the session's `pid` file located at `<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/<name>/pid`.

**What happens when stop runs:**

1. `workbench stop` reads the session's `pid` file.
2. Sends SIGTERM to the process.
3. The SIGTERM handler in `cmd_start` intercepts the signal, writes a `[FORCED_BLOCKED_ON_STOP] session=<name>` audit comment to the in-flight work unit, marks the work unit `blocked`, and exits with rc=0.
4. The session directory is NOT cleaned up automatically -- run `workbench sessions --cleanup` afterward to remove the stale entry.

**Flags:**

- `--session <name>` -- REQUIRED. The name of the session to stop. Exits 1 with an actionable error when the session does not exist in the registry, the `pid` file is missing, or the process is not running.

**Exit codes:**

| Scenario | rc |
|----------|----|
| SIGTERM delivered successfully. | 0 |
| Session not found in registry. | 1 |
| PID file missing or unreadable. | 1 |
| Process already exited (stale session). | 1 (with actionable message; run `workbench sessions --cleanup`). |
| `--session` flag omitted. | 2 (argument-parse error). |

**Worked example:**

```bash
# Stop the session named "alpha" and block its in-flight work unit:
uv run workbench stop --session alpha
# The orchestrator for session "alpha" receives SIGTERM, blocks its WU, and exits.
# The in-flight WU now carries: [FORCED_BLOCKED_ON_STOP] session=alpha

# Clean up the stale session entry:
uv run workbench sessions --cleanup
```

## Scope selectors (printer-pages syntax)

The `--include` and `--exclude` flags on `workbench start`, `workbench status`, `workbench report`, and `workbench next` all accept the same printer-pages-style token syntax described here. `workbench scope set` uses the same parser.

### Token types

Tokens are comma-separated strings. Whitespace around commas is ignored. Evaluation order: the include set is expanded first; then the exclude set is expanded and subtracted from it.

#### Single-ID token

A single-ID token matches the exact work-unit ID and every descendant. Descendants are IDs that start with `<token>-`.

Examples:

| Token | Matches |
|-------|---------|
| `E5` | `E5`, `E5-F1`, `E5-F1-S2`, `E5-F1-S2-T3`, ... (all WUs under epic E5) |
| `E5-F1` | `E5-F1`, `E5-F1-S1`, `E5-F1-S1-T1`, ... (all WUs under feature E5-F1) |
| `E5-F1-S2-T3` | `E5-F1-S2-T3` only (leaf task; no descendants) |

#### Range token

A range token consists of two adjacent same-type segments at the end of the token (both sharing the same letter prefix such as `E`, `F`, `S`, or `T`, but differing in the numeric suffix). The range expands inclusively on the final segment; earlier segments must match exactly.

Syntax: `<common-prefix><type><start>-<type><end>` where `start <= end`.

Examples:

| Token | Matches |
|-------|---------|
| `E1-E3` | all WUs under epics E1, E2, and E3 |
| `E5-F1-F3` | all WUs under features E5-F1, E5-F2, and E5-F3 |
| `E5-F1-S1-T2-T5` | tasks E5-F1-S1-T2, T3, T4, T5 and their descendants |

#### Mixed comma-separated list (union)

Multiple tokens are joined as a union. The result is the union of all matched IDs, then subtracted by the exclude set.

Example:

```bash
--include "E1-E3, E5"
# matches: all WUs under E1, E2, E3, and E5
```

### Exclude subtraction

`--exclude` tokens are expanded the same way as `--include` tokens. The expanded exclude set is then subtracted from the expanded include set. Evaluation order:

1. Expand all `--include` tokens (or use all backlog IDs when `--include` is empty).
2. Expand all `--exclude` tokens.
3. Subtract the exclude set from the include set.

Example:

```bash
--include "E1-E10" --exclude "E5, E7-F3"
# include set: all WUs under E1 through E10
# exclude set: all WUs under E5 + all WUs under E7-F3
# result: all WUs under E1-E4, E6, E7 (except E7-F3 descendants), E8-E10
```

### Edge cases

- **Reverse range** (`E3-E1`, `T5-T2`): rejected immediately with an actionable error message naming the token and the required ascending order. Exit code 1.
- **Out-of-range token** (no matching WU in the backlog): emits a `WARNING` log line naming the token but does not abort. The run continues with the matched IDs from other tokens.
- **Empty `--include`** (flag omitted): all backlog IDs are included before any exclusions. The existing behaviour is fully preserved (AC-190-9).
- **Malformed token** (leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens, e.g. `-E1`, `E1-`, `E1--E3`): rejected immediately with an actionable error message. Exit code 1.

### scope.json persistence

When `workbench start --include "..."` or `workbench scope set --include "..."` runs, the parsed scope is persisted to `<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json`:

```json
{
  "include": ["E1-E3", "E5"],
  "exclude": [],
  "expanded_ids": ["E1-F1-S1-T1", "..."],
  "started_at": "2026-05-14T13:42:11Z",
  "started_by": "matt"
}
```

- Written atomically (temp-then-rename) so concurrent readers never see a partial file.
- Consumed (deleted) on clean orchestrator exit (`workbench start` clean shutdown). Survives orchestrator crashes.
- `workbench status`, `workbench report`, and `workbench next` consult the file automatically when no per-command `--include`/`--exclude` flags are supplied. Per-command flags override the file for that invocation only.
- `workbench validate-backlog` ignores `scope.json` entirely -- it always validates the whole backlog regardless of active scope.

---

## Orchestration and reporting

See the [report](#report), [watch](#watch), [hook-tail](#hook-tail), and [watchdog](#watchdog) entries under Backlog read.

The main entry point for running the orchestrator is `make start` (non-interactive, recommended). Live observation while non-interactive runs is available via `workbench hook-tail` (every tool call streamed), `workbench report` (live progress dashboard), and `workbench status` -- so opening interactive mode just to see what's happening is unnecessary. `make start-interactive` exists for guided walk-throughs but should not be used to intervene mid-claim. Corrections happen between runs through two tools: the `workbench` CLI for state transitions / dep wiring (`set-status`, `decline`, `add-dep`, etc.), and Claude (separate session) for editing the work-unit `.md` content (Approach, Manifest, ACs, new work units). See [README Interactive Mode](../README.md#interactive-mode) and [`zero-to-ready.md`](zero-to-ready.md) Step 10 for the full split.

---

## Orchestrator helpers (invoked by agents)

These commands are the API surface the orchestrate SKILL and its subagents use. Operators rarely call them directly; they appear in hook-log traces and in audit comment lines. All respect the same env-var and config-path contract as operator commands.

### `get-diff`

```
uv run workbench get-diff <id>
```

Print the combined git diff for the work unit's target repo, scoped to *what this work unit changed*. Used by review agents (all five review judges plus `security-reviewer`) as the authoritative scope source; agents must not run raw `git diff origin/main` to compute scope (see ADR-12).

Mode-aware per ADR-12:

- **Per-task-branch mode** (default, `git_ops.defer_pr: false`): emits staged + unstaged + `git diff origin/<default_branch>` + untracked hunks. Each work unit runs on its own branch, so the branch-vs-default diff IS the task's scope.
- **defer_pr mode** (`git_ops.single_branch: <branch>` + `git_ops.defer_pr: true`): emits staged + unstaged + untracked only. When staged and unstaged are both empty the executor has just committed, so `git show HEAD` is substituted. The branch-vs-default hunk is deliberately skipped because it would include every prior completed task's commits on the shared branch.

Exit 0 on success; exit 1 when the work unit is not found or no local path is configured for its repo. Output is `(no changes)` when every hunk is empty.

### `run-tests`

```
uv run workbench run-tests <id>
```

Run the test suite in the work unit's target repo. Uses the repo's `make test` target when present; falls back to bare `pytest`. Used by `test_review`. Returns the test runner's exit code.

### `log`

```
uv run workbench log <message>
```

Append a free-form message to the orchestrator log. The destination path is resolved via `setup_logging` (`WORKBENCH_LOG_FILE` > `log_file:` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` > `<WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT>/logs/orchestrator.log` > source-tree default), so `workbench log` and `workbench report` always agree on the file. Not audited to the work-unit file. Useful for emitting narrative breadcrumbs from agents.

### `log-verdict`

```
uv run workbench log-verdict <judge> <id> <pass|fail> [feedback]
```

Record a judge verdict as an audit comment on the work-unit file. Writes `[REVIEW_PASS]` or `[REVIEW_FAIL]` (or `[SECURITY_FAIL]` for `security_review`). Feedback is mandatory when the verdict is `fail`; rejected by the `guard-verdict-format.sh` hook otherwise.

`<judge>` must be one of the names in the allowlist defined by `workbench.constants.KNOWN_JUDGE_NAMES`. The allowlist is split into two tiers:

- **Canonical reviewers (5)** -- `code_review`, `test_review`, `doc_review`, `changes_manifest`, `security_review`. Only these names satisfy the done-gate's `BacklogManager._last_round_all_passed` check. They are written by `review-supervisor` and `security-reviewer`.
- **Audit-only workflow agents (4)** -- `executor`, `blocker_resolver`, `manifest_amender`, `task_factory`. Their verdicts land in the work-unit Comments section as audit metadata but do NOT count toward the done-gate. Workflow agents use these to record progress (for example, the executor logging `executor` verdicts during AC enforcement, or task-factory recording `task_factory` after a successful materialise).

Two enforcement layers prevent malformed audit rows:

1. **CLI layer** (`cmd_log_verdict`): refuses any `<judge>` outside `KNOWN_JUDGE_NAMES` with a clear error naming the valid choices. Catches typos like `judge` (literal) or hyphenated forms like `code-reviewer`.
2. **Hook layer** (`guard-verdict-format.sh`, PreToolUse): mirrors the same allowlist, plus an additional **executor scope** rule -- when the calling agent's `agent_type == "workbench:executor"` AND the judge is one of the canonical 5 reviewers, the hook blocks. The executor is an authoring agent, not a reviewer; the audit-only `executor` judge name remains allowed (records progress without satisfying the gate). Other agents (review-supervisor, security-reviewer, main session) can still write canonical reviewer verdicts.

Override env var: none -- this is a security/correctness gate, not a tunable. If a legitimate use case needs to write a verdict outside the allowlist, extend `KNOWN_JUDGE_NAMES` in `src/workbench/constants.py` AND update `KNOWN_JUDGES` in `plugin/workbench-orchestrate/scripts/guard-verdict-format.sh` (the two lists must stay in sync).

### `log-comment`

```
uv run workbench log-comment <agent> <id> <message>
```

Append a non-verdict agent comment to the work-unit file's `## Comments` section with a timestamp and agent name prefix. Blocked by the `guard-comment-format.sh` hook when the message contains control-language imperatives (for example `halt orchestration`, `operator action required`); see [docs/faq.md](faq.md) for the rule and rationale.

### `log-tdd`

```
uv run workbench log-tdd <id> <RED|GREEN|REFACTOR> <message>
```

Append a TDD phase entry to the work-unit's `## TDD Cycle Log` section. Enforces the phase token (must be `RED`, `GREEN`, or `REFACTOR`, case-insensitive).

---

## Git operations

### `ensure-branch`

```
uv run workbench ensure-branch <id>
```

Create or switch to the work-unit branch before the executor runs. Branch name resolves from the work-unit file's `- **Branch:** ...` field; defaults to `backlog/<id-lower>`. In single-branch mode, switches to the configured `single_branch` instead. Handles dirty trees via stash-pop.

Under `git_ops.local_only: true`, branch creation skips `git fetch origin` entirely and creates the new branch off the **local** default ref (`refs/heads/<default_branch>`). The YAML-configured `default_branch` is mandatory in this mode; there is no `origin/HEAD` fallback.

### `git-ops`

```
uv run workbench git-ops <id>
```

Commit, push, create PR, wait for CI, merge. The full git-ops sequence runs after every review judge passes and before `mark-done`. In single-branch + `defer_pr: true` mode, commits locally only (no push, no PR); the shared branch is pushed by `git-ops-finalize` after every unit is done. Under `git_ops.local_only: true` (which requires `defer_pr: true`), git-ops also commits locally only -- and `git-ops-finalize` is **never** run, since there is no remote to push to.

Enforces three deterministic safety rails:
- **Manifest-scope:** staged files must exactly match the work unit's Changes Manifest (AC-FINAL-015).
- **Branch-anchor:** HEAD must be on the expected branch (prevents orphan-branch commits).
- **Orphan-pattern:** no staged or already-tracked path may match a build/state ignore pattern (terraform state, terragrunt cache, Python pycache, coverage artefacts, `node_modules`, `.DS_Store`). The default behaviour (Phase 1 of the orphan-cascade fix) is **inline cleanup**: git-ops runs `cleanup_tracked_orphans` programmatically, commits the result as a workbench-authored chore commit (canonical message `chore(cleanup): untrack workbench-managed orphan paths and update .gitignore`), then continues with the original task's commit on the same invocation. Two commits land on the task's branch; the executor's staging is preserved (filtered to exclude orphan paths). When the operator sets `WORKBENCH_DISABLE_INLINE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP=1`, git-ops falls back to the legacy proposal flow (cleanup-as-task) with cross-task de-duplication so two parents detecting the same orphan set wire to the SAME cleanup task. Override the active pattern list per backlog via `WORKBENCH_ORPHAN_IGNORE_PATTERNS` (comma-separated fnmatch globs).

Each rail exits 1 with a clear diagnostic when violated.

#### Exit code contract

The orchestrator skill ([`plugin/workbench-orchestrate/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md`](../plugin/workbench-orchestrate/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md) step 8) handles each non-zero exit code distinctly:

| rc | Meaning |
|----|---------|
| 0 | PR merged (or commit landed locally in deferred mode). |
| 1 | Hard failure -- block the task with a `[BLOCKED]` audit comment. |
| 2 | CI failed; executor retry budget not exhausted. Audit comment `[CI_FAIL]` names the trimmed log under `.workbench/ci-failures/<id>-<n>.log`. Re-invoke the executor with `ci-fail` feedback, then re-run git-ops. (Issue #115; **default on**. Disable via `git_ops.ci_failure_retry: false` in `workbench.yaml` or env `WORKBENCH_CI_FAILURE_RETRY_ENABLED=0`.) |
| 3 | PR has unresolved review feedback; executor retry budget not exhausted. Audit comment `[PR_BOT_FAIL]` names the JSON feedback file under `.workbench/pr-bot-feedback/<id>-<n>.json`. Re-invoke the executor with `pr-bot` feedback, then re-run git-ops. (Issue #116; opt-in. Enable via `git_ops.pr_review_resolution.enabled: true` in `workbench.yaml` or env `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_RESOLUTION_ENABLED=1`.) |

The retry budget for rc=2 / rc=3 is shared with the existing review-judge retry budget (`MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`); when exhausted, git-ops returns rc=1 instead of 2/3 and writes a `[CI_FAIL_BLOCKED]` / `[PR_BOT_FAIL_BLOCKED]` marker so the operator sees the full failure surface.

Every toggle below resolves with **env > YAML > default** precedence. Boolean env values are case-insensitive: truthy = `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`; falsy = `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`. Any other value fails fast at process start with a `ValueError`.

#### CI-failure retry (issue #115, default on)

Default-on as of v-next; opt out via `git_ops.ci_failure_retry: false` in `workbench.yaml` (or env `WORKBENCH_CI_FAILURE_RETRY_ENABLED=0`). When `wait_for_checks_and_classify` returns a non-GREEN `CIResult` (i.e. `FAILED_KNOWN_TASK`, `FAILED_UNKNOWN`, or `TIMEOUT`):

1. `gh pr checks --json name,state,link` identifies the failing run.
2. `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` fetches the log; the trailing `WORKBENCH_CI_FAILURE_LOG_BYTES` bytes (default 32 KiB) are saved to `.workbench/ci-failures/<task-id>-<attempt>.log`.
3. A `[CI_FAIL]` audit comment names the log path; rc=2 signals the orchestrator to re-invoke the executor.
4. After `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` retries the path transitions to `[CI_FAIL_BLOCKED]` + rc=1.

#### PR review-comment polling (issue #116, opt-in)

Configure via YAML `git_ops.pr_review_resolution:` block (every sub-field
overridable via the env vars below). Or stay env-only:

Set `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_RESOLUTION_ENABLED=1` AND configure at least one signal (a non-empty `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_AGENTS` allowlist or `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_DECISION_BLOCKS=1`) to enable. After `wait_for_checks_and_classify` returns `CIResult.GREEN`, git-ops polls `gh pr view --json reviewDecision,reviews` and `gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments` for up to `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS` seconds (default 60), polling every `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_POLL_INTERVAL` seconds (default 5). The poll exits early on the first signal; otherwise the merge proceeds. Knobs:

| env var | default | purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_RESOLUTION_ENABLED` | unset (off) | top-level toggle |
| `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_AGENTS` | empty | comma-separated bot login allowlist (e.g. `github-copilot[bot],amazon-q-developer[bot]`) whose unresolved comments block merge |
| `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_DECISION_BLOCKS` | True | whether `reviewDecision == CHANGES_REQUESTED` blocks merge |
| `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS` | 60 | total poll budget |
| `WORKBENCH_PR_REVIEW_POLL_INTERVAL` | 5 | per-poll cadence |

#### Workflow-registration race defence (issue #114)

The `wait_for_checks_and_classify` step that runs between `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` no longer treats `gh pr checks --watch` returning `"no checks reported"` as an unconditional pass. The previous behaviour merged before GitHub Actions had a chance to enqueue the workflow when CI was actually configured. The new disambiguation:

- **Repo has no `.github/workflows/*.y[a]ml` files locally**: legitimate "no CI configured" -> pass immediately (legacy fast path).
- **Repo has at least one workflow file**: race condition. Retry `gh pr checks` up to `WORKBENCH_CHECK_REGISTRATION_RETRIES` times (default 12), sleeping `WORKBENCH_CHECK_REGISTRATION_DELAY_SECONDS` between attempts (default 5). 12 * 5 = 60s of default coverage for the GitHub Actions queue.
- **Retry exhausted**: refuse the merge with an actionable error naming the PR number, the elapsed wait, and the workflow files found. No warn-and-pass fallback.

Operators with unusual CI cadence override the knobs via the env vars above. Defaults live in `src/workbench/constants.py` (`DEFAULT_CHECK_REGISTRATION_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_CHECK_REGISTRATION_DELAY_SECONDS`).

### `git-ops-finalize`

```
uv run workbench git-ops-finalize <repo>
```

Single-branch mode only: push the shared branch and create one PR for every accumulated commit. Use once, after every work unit targeting this repo is done. See [architecture.md §6](architecture.md#6-multi-pr-vs-single-pr-mode) for the full single-branch mode reference.

Not applicable under `git_ops.local_only: true` -- the target repo has no remote to push to. The local single branch is the deliverable; running `git-ops-finalize` against a local-only workspace is an error.

**Slack notifications** (issue #219): when the operator has the corresponding `notifications.events.*` toggle enabled, `git-ops-finalize` fires `pr_opened` immediately after `gh pr create` succeeds, then fires `ci_failure` (FAILED_KNOWN_TASK or FAILED_UNKNOWN) or `ci_pass` (GREEN) when the CI watch resolves. `pr_merged` is NOT fired from this path because `auto_merge: false` leaves the squashed PR open for manual merge. The new `ci_pass` toggle defaults to `false` on upgrade.

### `check-merge`

```
uv run workbench check-merge <id>
```

Issue #101 reconciliation step for `pause_before_merge: true` workspaces. Queries `gh pr list --head <branch> --json number,state,merged,url` for the PR associated with the work unit's branch and dispatches:

- **PR merged externally**: promote the work unit to `done` via the existing done-gate (every required judge must have passed in the most recent round). Logs `[PR_MERGED]` audit comment.
- **PR closed without merge**: transition the work unit to `blocked` with a `[BLOCKED]` audit comment naming the PR.
- **PR still open**: no-op; the orchestrator's loop picks the work unit up again on the next iteration.
- **No PR found for branch**: prints `{"pr_state": "no-pr-found"}` and returns 0; the orchestrator treats it the same as "still open".

Returns rc=0 in every normal case; rc=1 only on hard failure (gh API failure, malformed JSON, done-gate refusal). Output is a single JSON line so the orchestrator skill's step 1b reconciliation can parse it.

The orchestrator skill (`plugin/workbench-orchestrate/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md`) calls this command on every `in-review` work unit at the top of each loop iteration when `git_ops.pause_before_merge: true` is set in the YAML. See [`docs/git-ops-modes.md`](git-ops-modes.md) for the full pause-before-merge mode reference and [ADR-13](adr/13-pause-before-merge.md) for the design rationale.

### `git-ops` orphan-pattern auto-emit (Phase 10 hardening)

When the `git-ops` command refuses a commit because of detected orphan paths, the auto-emitted cleanup proposal claims `.gitignore`. If a pre-existing in-queue / blocked / proposed peer task already lists `.gitignore` in its own `## Changes Manifest`, the auto-emitter now scans the live index and auto-wires `add-dep <peer> <new-cleanup>` for every conflicting peer in the SAME repo. The dep-chain is what the E224 Manifest-Conflict rule already accepts as a valid resolution -- so a backlog that previously halted with `Manifest conflict on '.gitignore' ... claimed by <peer>, <new-cleanup>` now auto-resolves and the orchestrator continues without operator intervention. Tasks already in `done` / `declined` are skipped (they are terminal). The auto-wired peer IDs appear in the stderr message that the auto-emit prints.

### `cleanup-tracked-orphans`

```
uv run workbench cleanup-tracked-orphans <org/repo|repo-path> [--dry-run]
```

Untrack build/state artefacts (terraform state, `.terragrunt-cache/`, terraform provider binaries, Python `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc`, `.coverage*`, `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`) and write a workbench-managed block to the repo's root `.gitignore` so future commits cannot reintroduce the same shapes.

The argument accepts either an `org/repo` key from `workbench.yaml`'s `repos:` map (resolved via that repo's `checkout_directory`) or a direct filesystem path to a git repo.

Behaviour:

- Walks `git ls-files` and matches each tracked entry against the active orphan pattern list.
- Runs `git rm --cached --quiet` on every match (preserves the file on disk; subsequent commit removes the tracked entry going forward; existing history is NOT rewritten).
- Appends the canonical `.gitignore` block under the `# workbench-managed: tracked-orphan cleanup defaults` header. Idempotent: re-running on a repo that already contains the header is a no-op.
- Writes JSON to stdout summarising `detected_count`, `removed_count`, `gitignore_updated`, and the paths involved.

Override the default patterns per backlog via `WORKBENCH_ORPHAN_IGNORE_PATTERNS` (comma-separated fnmatch globs replacing the built-in list). Use `--dry-run` to preview without modifying state.

Self-resolving integration: `git-ops` invokes the same detection before every commit. When orphans are present, git-ops refuses the commit and auto-emits a `cleanup-tracked-orphans`-running follow-up task; the orchestrator's existing cascade picks it up the next iteration. Operators can also run this command directly to clear a polluted history-going-forward in one shot.

## Amendment workflow

See [manifest-amendments.md](manifest-amendments.md) and [ADR-02](adr/02-manifest-amendment-workflow.md) for the full design. This workflow is on by default; set `manifest_amendment.enabled: false` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` to opt out.

### `request-amendment`

```
cat <<'EOF' | uv run workbench request-amendment <id>
{
  "reason": "tdd_green_production_fix",
  "files_to_add": ["src/path/to/file.py"],
  "justification": "...",
  "linked_acs": ["AC-TEST-001"]
}
EOF
```

Register an amendment request at `<workspace>/.workbench/amendments/<id>.json`. Payload is JSON on stdin; the four fields above are required. Invoked by the executor during TDD GREEN when a production fix is needed but out of manifest scope.

### `apply-amendment`

```
uv run workbench apply-amendment <id>
```

Atomically update the Changes Manifest after the `manifest-amender` judge approves. Runs a deterministic Layer 3 post-check (em-dash scan plus `validate-backlog`) and rolls back on any failure, so a failed post-check cannot leave the backlog half-updated.

### `reject-amendment`

```
uv run workbench reject-amendment <id> <reason>
```

Reject the pending amendment, archive the request to `<workspace>/.workbench/rejected-requests/<id>-<timestamp>.json`, write a `[AMENDMENT_REJECTED]` audit comment, AND persist a structured rejection-feedback JSON to `<workspace>/.workbench/review-failures/<id>-manifest_amender-<n>.json` (issue #156, schema v1). The task is typically marked `blocked` and may trigger the task-factory flow (see below) if `blocker-resolver` emits a proposal. Legacy archives under `.workbench/amender-rejections/` are still readable for forward compatibility.

### `log-rejection-feedback`

```
uv run workbench log-rejection-feedback <judge> <task-id> --json '<payload>'
```

Persist a structured review-judge rejection JSON. `<judge>` is one of `code_review` / `test_review` / `doc_review` / `changes_manifest` / `security_review` / `manifest_amender`. `<payload>` must validate against `src/workbench/backlog/review-feedback-schema.json` -- in particular every `categories[*].code` must appear in the judge's controlled vocabulary (see `docs/review-feedback-vocabulary.md`). The JSON lands under `<workspace>/.workbench/review-failures/<task-id>-<judge>-<n>.json` and is consumed by the executor-feedback collector on retry and by the done-gate to refuse `mark-done` until each category is cleared via `[REJECTION_FEEDBACK_RESOLVED] <judge>:<code>` or escalated via `[NEEDS_DEP] <judge>:<code>`. Records over `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` are still written but stamped `capped: true`.

## Proposal workflow (task factory)

See [task-factory.md](task-factory.md) and ADRs [03](adr/03-task-factory.md), [06](adr/06-validation-gate-bug-escalation.md), [07](adr/07-auto-requeue-on-proposal-completion.md), [08](adr/08-proposal-lifecycle-observability.md), [09](adr/09-idempotent-materialise-proposal.md) for the full design. This workflow is opt-in: enable with `task_factory.enabled: true` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`.

### `write-proposal`

```
cat <<'EOF' | uv run workbench write-proposal <source-id>
{
  "source_task_id": "E0-F1-S1-T1",
  "generated_at": "2026-04-19T03:25:00Z",
  "rejection_reason": "...",
  "proposed_tasks": [
    { "suggested_id": "E0-F1-S1-T2", "title": "...", ... }
  ]
}
EOF
```

Persist a proposal JSON to `<workspace>/.workbench/proposals/<source-id>.json`. Payload is JSON on stdin. Written either by `blocker-resolver` (amendment-rejected path) or by the executor directly (validation-gate escalation path).

**Auto-cascade when `auto_accept_proposals: true`:** with the flag set in `workbench.yaml`'s `task_factory:` section, `write-proposal` ALSO calls `materialise-proposal` and `promote-proposal` synchronously inside the same Python invocation. The cascade is therefore actionable the moment the JSON lands -- the source task's `## Dependencies` table is wired with a `proposed`-status row immediately, the cascade-classifier moves it into the `auto-clearing via proposal` bucket, and the orchestrator's next iteration claims the materialised draft.

This closes a timing window in which a resolver-written proposal could sit orphaned for up to one full orchestrator iteration (between the resolver's `write-proposal` call and the next `sweep-proposals` cycle) -- long enough for the source task to read as "needs operator attention" even though the auto-resolution path was already on disk.

The auto-cascade is best-effort: any `ProposalError` during materialise or promote is logged and reported in the output JSON's `auto_cascade` / `error` fields but does NOT propagate as a non-zero exit. The JSON is already on disk; the next `sweep-proposals` cycle retries the cascade.

Output shape:

```json
{
  "source_task_id": "E0-F1-S1-T1",
  "proposal_path": "/.../E0-F1-S1-T1.json",
  "auto_cascade": "applied" | "disabled" | "failed",
  "materialised": ["/.../E0-F1-S1-T9.md"],   // when applied
  "promoted":     ["E0-F1-S1-T9"],            // when applied
  "error": "..."                              // when failed
}
```

When `auto_accept_proposals: false` the behaviour is unchanged from prior versions: the JSON is written and the operator promotes manually via `promote-proposal`.

### `materialise-proposal`

```
uv run workbench materialise-proposal <source-id>
```

Turn a proposal JSON into draft `.md` files with status `proposed` under the matching story directory. Each proposed task also gets a row appended to `BACKLOG.md`.

**Idempotent (ADR-09).** Every task classifies through `classify_proposed_task` first; the call skips anything in state `PROPOSED`, `PROMOTED`, `DONE`, `DECLINED`, or `REJECTED`. Only `UNMATERIALISED` tasks are created. Safe to re-run after a partial materialisation or after rejecting a draft from the same JSON. Output JSON includes a `skipped` map so the operator sees why a no-op call was a no-op.

### `sweep-proposals`

```
uv run workbench sweep-proposals
```

Best-effort materialise every pending proposal JSON in `<workspace>/.workbench/proposals/`. Runs `materialise-proposal` against each, tolerating per-proposal `ProposalError` (safety-guard refusals log and continue). Output lines:

- `sweep-proposals: materialised <source-id>: N new, M skipped`
- `sweep-proposals: skipped <source-id>: <reason>`
- `sweep-proposals: no-op <source-id>` (every task already resolved)
- `sweep-proposals: nothing to do (no proposal JSONs on disk)`

When `task_factory.auto_accept_proposals: true` is set in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` (ADR-11), sweep also auto-promotes every `PROPOSED` draft in each proposal after the materialise pass. The output line gains a parenthetical count:

```
sweep-proposals: materialised <source-id>: N new, M skipped (auto-promoted: K)
```

Per-draft promote failures are logged to stderr and do not abort the sweep. When the flag is `false` (default), the output is byte-identical to the pre-ADR-11 format. See [ADR-11: Auto-accept proposals](adr/11-auto-accept-proposals.md) and the [task-factory doc](task-factory.md) for the full auto-accept contract.

Invoked by the orchestrate SKILL as step 0 on every loop iteration; safe to run manually at any time.

### `promote-proposal`

```
uv run workbench promote-proposal [--no-dep-on-source] <task-id>
uv run workbench promote-proposal --all-from <source-task-id>
```

Flip a proposed draft from `proposed` to `in-queue` and wire it as a dependency of the source task + every peer listed in the proposal's `affected_task_ids` field (ADR-10). Writes `[PROPOSAL_PROMOTED]` + a `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL] <task-id>` marker on every wired target so the ADR-07 auto-requeue cascade reaches each of them when this task completes.

- `--no-dep-on-source` skips the Dependencies-table row on the SOURCE task only; every entry in `affected_task_ids` still gets its marker + row. Use the flag when the promoted draft is independent of its source task, not to suppress peer-task wiring.
- `--all-from <source-task-id>` promotes every task in that source's proposal in one call.
- When the proposal JSON sets `source_dep_direction: "test_validates_source"`, the command auto-applies `--no-dep-on-source` and emits a `NOTE:` to stderr. When the heuristic (proposal's `title` starts with `Add tests/`, `Add unit tests`, `Add integration tests`, `Verify`, `Validate`, `Assert`; or every entry in `files_to_own` is under `tests/`) matches WITHOUT the explicit flag, the command emits a `WARNING:` and keeps the default direction; re-run with `--no-dep-on-source` if the warning's recommendation applies. See [task-factory.md](task-factory.md) "When to use --no-dep-on-source".

Fail-fast: if any target in `[source_task_id] + affected_task_ids` is missing from the backlog index, the call raises `ProposalError` BEFORE writing anything, so a missing peer never leaves the source half-wired.

Output JSON:

```json
{
  "task_id": "E1-F1-S16-T2",
  "status": "in-queue",
  "file_path": "/abs/path/E1-F1-S16-T2.md",
  "wired_targets": ["E1-F1-S16-T1", "E1-F1-S15-T1"]
}
```

`wired_targets` lists every task that received a marker on this call (source first, then affected in declared order).

### `add-dep`

```
uv run workbench add-dep <blocked-task-id> <blocker-task-id> [--reason "<audit message>"]
```

Wire a `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL] <blocker-task-id>` marker and a Dependencies-table row on `<blocked-task-id>`'s work-unit file. The ADR-07 cascade then auto-unblocks `<blocked-task-id>` when `<blocker-task-id>` reaches `done` or `declined`. See [ADR-10: Multi-target proposal wiring](adr/10-multi-target-proposal-wiring.md).

Use this when the `promote-proposal` flow does not cover your case:

- You realise AFTER a promote that a peer task should have been in `affected_task_ids` and want to wire it retroactively.
- You hand-authored a work unit (not via task-factory) that unblocks another task.
- You are correcting a proposal authored without `affected_task_ids`.

Fail-fast:

- Both IDs must match the `E<N>-F<N>-S<N>-T<N>` task-ID format.
- `<blocker-task-id>` must exist in the backlog index.
- `<blocker-task-id>` must NOT be in a terminal state (`done` / `declined`); wiring a dep on terminal work is a no-op and almost always a mistake.
- `<blocked-task-id>` must exist in the backlog index.
- `<blocked-task-id>` and `<blocker-task-id>` cannot be the same.

Warns (does not refuse) when `<blocked-task-id>` is not currently in `blocked` status -- the ADR-07 cascade only fires on blocked tasks, so wiring a marker on an in-queue task is harmless metadata; the operator almost certainly meant to flip to blocked first.

Idempotent: if either the Dependencies row or the marker is already present, the corresponding write is skipped. `wired: false` in the output JSON means the call was a complete no-op.

Output JSON:

```json
{
  "blocked": "E1-F1-S16-T1",
  "blocker": "E1-F1-S16-T2",
  "wired": true,
  "reason": "post-promote correction for shared 14-test blocker"
}
```

### `reject-proposal`

```
uv run workbench reject-proposal <task-id> --reason "<message>"
uv run workbench reject-proposal --unmaterialised <source-task-id> --reason "<message>"
```

Two forms:

1. **Per-draft reject** (first form) -- archives the draft `.md` to `<workspace>/.workbench/rejected-proposals/<task-id>-<timestamp>.md`, removes the BACKLOG.md row, writes a `[PROPOSAL_REJECTED]` audit comment on the source, strips the `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]` marker, and invokes the auto-requeue cascade. If the source's remaining markers are all terminal, the source auto-unblocks.
2. **Un-materialised reject** (`--unmaterialised <source-id>`) -- archives the whole proposal JSON to `<workspace>/.workbench/rejected-proposals/<source-id>-unmaterialised-<timestamp>.json` and writes a `[PROPOSAL_JSON_REJECTED]` audit comment. Refuses when any task in the JSON already has a materialised draft; use the per-draft form for those first.

Exactly one form must be supplied; missing or both-supplied raises an argument-parse error. `--reason` is required and non-empty.
