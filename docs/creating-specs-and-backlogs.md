# Creating Specs and Backlogs for Workbench

How to produce a specification, break it into a backlog, and structure work units so Workbench can execute them reliably. This guide applies to any project type -- application development, infrastructure migration, cloud operations, or platform engineering.

## Overview

Workbench executes work from a structured backlog. The quality of execution depends directly on the quality of the backlog. A vague work unit produces vague code. A precise work unit with clear acceptance criteria, lifecycle tests, and code standards produces reliable, reviewable output.

The process has seven phases (this guide walks through each):

1. **Spec** -- Understand the problem, audit the codebase, document every detail
2. **Backlog structure** -- Pick a hierarchy (epics → features → stories → tasks)
3. **Work unit authoring** -- Write each task with the required sections
4. **Code Standards block** -- Embed the rules every task must follow
5. **Lifecycle Journey Tests** -- Add end-to-end cycle ACs
6. **Git Strategy** -- Multi-PR (default) vs single-PR mode
7. **Validation** -- Run `workbench validate-backlog` before execution

For the wider context (how the orchestrator consumes this backlog, multi-PR vs single-PR mode, judge architecture), see the [architecture overview](architecture.md).

---

## Phase 1: Writing the Specification

### Start with an audit, not a plan

Before writing any spec, deeply explore the codebase you're changing. Use agents to inventory:

- Every source file, its line count, classes, functions, and imports
- Every test file, its test count, and what it covers
- Every configuration file, dependency, and entry point
- Every cross-reference and integration point
- Every `__file__` path assumption, global state, dynamic import, or process-level side effect

The goal is to find every landmine before you step on it. The spec must address every issue found during the audit.

### Spec structure

A spec should contain:

1. **Context** -- Why this change is being made, what prompted it, the intended outcome
2. **Current state** -- Precise inventory of what exists today (file counts, line counts, test counts)
3. **Target state** -- Architecture after the change, with file tree showing every new/modified file
4. **Critical challenges** -- Problems discovered during audit that must be solved (not just listed)
5. **Migration/implementation phases** -- Ordered steps, each independently verifiable
6. **Automated test plan** -- Every deterministic test that will be written, organized by category
7. **Agent-executed test plan** -- Manual integration tests the agent runs against real repos
8. **Risk assessment** -- What can go wrong, severity, and mitigation for each
9. **Out of scope** -- What is explicitly not being done
10. **Definition of done** -- Checklist of every criterion that must be true before declaring complete

### Bug backlog

During the audit, document every bug, edge case, or fragile code pattern found. Create a separate bug backlog file prioritized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low). Each bug should have:

- File and line number
- Description of the problem
- Impact if not fixed
- Proposed fix

Reference the bug backlog from the spec. Plan when each bug gets fixed (as part of the migration, or separately).

### Critical review

After writing the spec, review it critically for:

- Missing files in the inventory
- Missing imports that need updating
- Dynamic code loading patterns (e.g., `__import__()`, `importlib`)
- `__file__` path assumptions that break when code moves
- Global state that leaks between calls
- Process-level operations (`os.execv()`, `sys.exit()`, signal handlers) that break when called as a library
- Non-Python runtime files (scripts, hooks, data files, docs read at runtime)
- Hard-coded organization-specific values

---

## Phase 2: Building the Backlog

### Hierarchy

Workbench uses a four-level hierarchy:

```
Epic (E0)           -- The entire initiative
  Feature (E0-F1)   -- A major capability area
    Story (E0-F1-S1) -- A commit-sized unit of work
      Task (E0-F1-S1-T1) -- A single TDD cycle (test + implement)
```

**Epics** scope the whole project. One epic per initiative.
**Features** group related stories. Each feature is a major subsystem (e.g., "Create Python API", "Fix all bugs", "Update documentation").
**Stories** produce commits. Every story is a commit. All tasks within a story must pass before the commit.
**Tasks** are the atomic work units that Workbench executes. Each task follows TDD: write failing test, implement, verify.

### Directory structure

```
backlog/
  config/
    workbench.yaml
  E0/
    E0.md
    E0-F1/
      E0-F1.md
      E0-F1-S1/
        E0-F1-S1.md
        E0-F1-S1-T1.md
        E0-F1-S1-T2.md
      E0-F1-S2/
        ...
    E0-F2/
      ...
```

Each level gets its own directory. Files are named by their ID. `BACKLOG.md` at the workspace root indexes everything.

### BACKLOG.md index

```markdown
## Full Work Unit Index

| ID | Title | Type | Status | Dependencies | Repo | File Path |
|-----|-------|------|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| E0 | My Initiative | Epic | in-queue | None | org/repo | `backlog/E0/E0.md` |
| E0-F1 | Feature One | Feature | in-queue | None | org/repo | `backlog/E0/E0-F1/E0-F1.md` |
...

## Status Summary

| Epic | Title | Done | In Progress | In Queue | Blocked |
|------|-------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| E0 | My Initiative | 0 | 0 | 42 | 0 |
```

The Status Summary uses per-epic rows with columns: Epic, Title, Done, In Progress, In Queue, Blocked. The count is descendants only (the epic row itself is not counted).

### Dependency chains

Dependencies control execution order. A task is actionable only when all its dependencies are `done`.

- Tasks within a story depend on each other sequentially (T1 before T2 before T3)
- Stories within a feature depend on the previous story (S2 depends on S1)
- Features can run in parallel if their dependency chains are independent
- Cross-feature dependencies are specified explicitly

Every task should list what it depends on AND what depends on it (the latter as `### Depends On This` inside the Description).

### TDD pairing

Tasks should come in pairs:

1. **Test task** (TDD RED): Write failing tests for the functionality
2. **Implementation task** (TDD GREEN): Implement to make tests pass

This ensures tests exist before code, and the agent cannot skip testing.

---

## Phase 3: Structuring Work Units

### Task file format (workbench contract)

Valid `## Status:` values: `in-queue`, `in-progress`, `in-review`, `done`, `blocked`, `proposed`, `declined`. See [docs/faq.md](faq.md#whats-the-difference-between-blocked-and-declined) for the semantics of each and [docs/adr/05-declined-status.md](adr/05-declined-status.md) for the rationale behind `declined`.

```markdown
# {ID}: {Title}

## Status: in-queue

## Target Repository

- **Repo:** `org/repo`
- **Branch:** `backlog/{id_lower}`

## Description

{Detailed description.}

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] All dependency work units are `done`
- [ ] Target repository is accessible
- [ ] No open questions about the spec

### Depends On This

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Approach

1. **TDD RED:** Write failing tests
2. **TDD GREEN:** Implement
3. **TDD REFACTOR:** Clean up
4. **Verify:** Run full suite

### Code Standards

{Full code standards block -- copy from [Phase 4: Code Standards Block](#phase-4-code-standards-block) below.}

### Related Specifications

- **Spec:** `specs/my-spec.md` -- Section X, Phase Y

## Dependencies

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-FUNC-001 {Functional requirement}
- [ ] AC-TEST-001 {Test requirement}
- [ ] AC-CYCLE-001 {Lifecycle validation}
- [ ] AC-LINT-001 Lint passes
- [ ] AC-SEC-001 No secrets

## Changes Manifest

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/file.py` | New -- description |

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria checked
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Only manifest files staged

## TDD Cycle Log

## Comments
```

### Key design principles

**1. Sections that workbench parses must be `##` headings:**
Status, Target Repository, Description, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, Changes Manifest, Definition of Done, TDD Cycle Log, Comments.

**2. Custom sections go inside `## Description` as `###` sub-headings:**
Definition of Ready, Depends On This, Approach, Code Standards, Related Specifications. These are visible to the executor agent as part of the parsed description.

**3. Code Standards are repeated in every task:**
Context windows compress over time. Having the rules fresh in every work unit prevents drift. This is intentional repetition, not DRY violation -- each work unit is an independent execution context.

**4. Acceptance criteria use typed prefixes:**
- `AC-FUNC-NNN` -- Functional requirements (what the code must do)
- `AC-TEST-NNN` -- Test requirements (what tests must exist)
- `AC-CYCLE-NNN` -- Lifecycle validation (real end-to-end cycle proving it works)
- `AC-DOC-NNN` -- Documentation requirements
- `AC-LINT-NNN` -- Lint/format requirements
- `AC-SEC-NNN` -- Security requirements

**5. Changes Manifest uses table format:**
`| File | Change |` with one row per file. This is what the changes_manifest judge validates against. See [docs/authoring-manifests.md](authoring-manifests.md) for the three patterns that avoid the most common authoring defect (test-only manifests on tasks whose Approach authorises TDD GREEN production fixes), and for the runtime amendment workflow that rescues cases the author could not anticipate.

**6. Every implementation task needs a lifecycle cycle AC:**
If a task implements behavior, it must have an `AC-CYCLE` that proves the behavior works in a real operation cycle -- not just that a unit test passes. Example: "After implementation, create a temp git repo, call the function, verify the output."

---

## Phase 4: Code Standards Block

Embed this in every task's `### Code Standards` section inside `## Description`. Adjust rules to your project's needs, but never remove the critical rules.

### Critical rules (violation = automatic rejection)

1. **NO FALLBACK LOGIC** -- Fail loudly. Never catch and silently continue.
2. **NO SILENT FAILURES** -- Every error to stderr with non-zero exit code.
3. **FAIL FAST** -- Detect errors early. Exit on first error with clear message.
4. **NO HARD-CODED VALUES** -- All constants in a dedicated constants module. All config from environment variables, config files, or function parameters.
5. **NO TEMPORAL LOGIC** -- No `sleep()`. Use readiness detection with configurable timeouts.
6. **ALL CODE DYNAMIC AND INPUT-DRIVEN** -- No static data, no magic numbers.
7. **NO BYPASS ANNOTATIONS** -- No `noqa`, `nosec`, `type: ignore`, `pragma: no cover`.
8. **NO UNICODE DASH-EMS** -- Use `--` (double hyphen), not the em-dash character (U+2014).

### Supporting rules

- **SOLID, DRY, 12-Factor** -- Standard architecture principles
- **TDD mandatory** -- Tests before implementation
- **No stub tests** -- Every assertion must be able to fail
- **Test error paths** -- Every error condition gets a test
- **Stage only** -- `git add` relevant files only. Never commit/push/create PRs.
- **No secrets** -- No credentials in source code
- **No eval()** -- Never execute dynamic code

---

## Phase 5: Lifecycle Journey Tests

The most important tests are lifecycle journeys -- they chain multiple operations into realistic user workflows. Every backlog should include journey tests that exercise the full cycle.

### Examples by project type

**Application development:**
```
bootstrap -> configure -> build -> test -> deploy -> verify -> teardown
```

**Infrastructure migration (e.g., VMware to EC2):**
```
discover inventory -> plan migration -> create target infra -> migrate workload -> validate connectivity -> cutover DNS -> verify application -> decommission source
```

**Cloud operations:**
```
provision resources -> configure security groups -> deploy application -> health check -> scale up -> scale down -> terminate
```

**Package manager (like mpm):**
```
bootstrap -> install -> verify packages -> validate manifests -> clean -> verify clean
install with marketplace -> verify plugins registered -> clean -> verify plugins removed
```

### Journey test structure

Each journey test should:
1. Set up real fixtures (git repos, config files, infrastructure state)
2. Execute the full chain of operations in order
3. Verify state at each step (not just the final state)
4. Clean up and verify cleanup is complete
5. Cover both the happy path and key error paths

---

## Phase 6: Git Strategy

Workbench supports two git workflow modes -- choose one when planning the backlog:

- **Multi-PR (default)** -- one branch and one PR per task. Best for independent work that can ship separately.
- **Single-PR (single-branch + defer_pr)** -- all tasks commit to one shared branch; one PR for the batch via `workbench git-ops-finalize <repo>` after all units complete. Best for large migrations where the entire backlog ships as one reviewable PR.

Single-PR mode is enabled in `workbench.yaml`:

```yaml
git_ops:
  single_branch: feat/my-feature
  defer_pr: true
```

For the full lifecycle and trade-offs of each mode, see [Multi-PR vs single-PR mode](architecture.md#6-multi-pr-vs-single-pr-mode) in the architecture doc.

## Phase 7: Validation

Before executing the backlog, run:

```bash
workbench validate-backlog
```

This checks:
1. Every file path in the index exists on disk
2. Status consistency between index and work unit files
3. No orphaned files (recursive scan including nested directories)
4. All dependency IDs reference real work units
5. Status Summary counts match actual distribution
6. Task files have non-empty Description
7. Task files have Acceptance Criteria with AC- items
8. Task files have Changes Manifest entries
9. Task files have Definition of Done section
10. No em-dash characters in work unit files

Fix all errors before starting execution.

## Real Example

The `mpm-migration-backlog` demonstrates this process for migrating a 23,000-line multi-repo management tool into a CLI package:

```
specs/
  SPEC-repo-to-mpm-migration.md    -- 800+ line spec with 14 phases
  BACKLOG-repo-bugs.md               -- 20 prioritized bugs found during audit
  SPEC-repo-greenfield-refactor.md   -- Future refactoring plan (out of scope)
  CODE-STANDARDS-BLOCK.md            -- Reusable code standards template
  TEMPLATE-work-unit.md              -- Work unit template

BACKLOG.md                            -- 116 work units indexed

backlog/
  config/workbench.yaml
  E0/                                 -- 1 Epic
    E0-F1/ through E0-F9/            -- 9 Features
      E0-F1-S1/ through ...          -- 17 Stories (= 17 commits)
        E0-F1-S1-T1.md through ...   -- 89 Tasks
```

Key metrics:
- 116 work units (1 epic, 9 features, 17 stories, 89 tasks)
- 17 commits in 1 PR
- Every task has full Code Standards block (8 critical rules)
- 14 lifecycle AC-CYCLE injections across implementation tasks
- 4 dedicated journey test tasks (bootstrap, marketplace, repo commands, cross-cutting)
- 7 E2E verification tasks per story
- 20 bug fixes with TDD (48 unit tests + 23 integration tests)
- `workbench validate-backlog` passes with zero errors

## Post-Backlog-A lessons-learned addenda

These sections were added based on operational lessons from Backlog A's first orchestration run. They are normative for new agentic backlog authoring; the original Phases 1-7 above are still authoritative for content not contradicted here.

### Phase 0 -- Discovery (required, before Phase 1)

Before authoring any spec, run the discovery checklist in [`backlog-author-discovery.md`](backlog-author-discovery.md). Inspect existing AWS Route53 zones, GitHub repos in the target org, AWS account topology, branch protection state, AWS Secrets Manager paths in scope, and DNS state. Record results in a `## Discovery` section of the spec. The spec MUST anchor decisions on observed state, not assumed state. Skipping discovery has produced full-spec rebrands mid-orchestration.

### Phase 0a -- Scaffolding work-unit files (E223)

For each new Epic / Feature / Story / Task scaffold its `.md` file via `workbench new-task --id <ID> --title "<TITLE>" --target <PATH>` rather than copying an existing file. The command renders the canonical template (`backlog/templates/{epic,feature,story,task}.md`) with placeholder substitutions and writes the file fail-fast: refuses overwrites, refuses missing parent directories, and infers the template kind from the ID's last segment (`T`/`S`/`F`/`E`). Optional flags (`--repo`, `--description`, `--source-file`, `--test-file`, `--ac-func`) populate the template's per-unit tokens; tokens with no flag get a deterministic default. The rendered file is immediately `validate-backlog`-clean -- it ships with all required sections (Status, Dependencies, Changes Manifest, etc.) so authors can flesh out content without fighting the contract.

### Phase 3 addendum -- Source/test atomicity

Per [`source-test-atomicity.md`](source-test-atomicity.md), every Python source file authored by a Task MUST have its matching test file in the SAME Task's `## Changes Manifest`. The historical "Test task (RED) + Implementation task (GREEN) pair" pattern documented above is OBSOLETE for Python work because workbench's `AC-FINAL-014` (100% coverage) cannot be satisfied during the source-authoring Task if its test is owned by a sibling Task. The split pattern remains acceptable only for RED-only TDD demonstrations where the Task explicitly intends to land a failing test as the artifact.

### Phase 3 addendum -- AC-FINAL canonical set + language tiering

Per [`acceptance-criteria-canonical.md`](acceptance-criteria-canonical.md), every Task's `## Acceptance Criteria` SHOULD include the canonical AC-FINAL-001..015 set. Each AC has explicit Applicability tags; for Tasks whose Manifest tier (Python / HCL / YAML / JSON / XML / TOML / Markdown / Mixed) does not match an AC's applicability, the author MUST append the verbatim suffix `-- N/A for <tier> Tasks (no <language> source authored)`. Failing to mark inapplicable ACs produces cascading proposal Tasks at orchestration time.

### Phase 3 addendum -- Manual external blockers

Per [`manual-blockers.md`](manual-blockers.md), dependencies that workbench cannot satisfy itself (cross-backlog handoffs, external-team work, human-only verification gates) are represented as `Status: blocked` Tasks anchored in `E0` with `DO NOT CLAIM` text in the description. Wire dependent Tasks via `workbench add-dep <dependent> <blocker>`. Do NOT rely on prose-level "Backlog A starts after Backlog B" commitments: the orchestrator does not read prose, it reads the `## Dependencies` table.

### Phase 3 addendum -- Cross-backlog dependencies

Per [`cross-backlog-dependencies.md`](cross-backlog-dependencies.md), if this backlog consumes outputs produced by a different backlog, anchor a manual blocker in this backlog's E0 and wire every dependent Task to it. Cross-backlog deps in `## Dependencies` rows referencing task IDs from another backlog's `BACKLOG.md` will fail `validate-backlog` (the IDs are unresolvable).

### Phase 8 -- Pre-flight checklist (required, before launching the orchestrator)

Before invoking `workbench start` for the first time on a backlog, run this triplet:

1. `workbench validate-backlog` exits 0.
2. `workbench check` exits 0 -- verifies symlinks, origin remotes, `default_branch` parity between `workbench.yaml` and remote, and absence of conflicting open PRs against `single_branch`.
3. `git status` in every target repo shows the workspace clean (no stale uncommitted edits that would conflict with `feat/<branch>` ensure-branch).

If any of (1)/(2)/(3) fails, halt and surface to the operator before launching. Empty target repos (no `main` commit) and `default_branch` mismatches between `workbench.yaml` and remote are the most common pre-flight failures observed.
