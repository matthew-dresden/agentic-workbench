"""Deterministic post-processing passes for backlog work-unit files.

The bundled ``spec-to-backlog`` skill is LLM-driven and can produce
backlog files that pass the per-task rubric but still trip
``workbench validate-backlog`` because of mechanical issues a deterministic
pass can fix without changing the spec semantics. Each function in this
module fixes one such class of issue. Functions are pure with respect to
the filesystem inputs:

- Each takes a ``backlog_dir`` ``Path``.
- Each returns ``int`` -- the number of files modified.
- Each is idempotent: re-running on the same backlog after a fix should
  modify zero additional files.
- Each accepts the optional ``scope_paths`` and ``force_terminal`` arguments
  documented below; passes default to skipping terminal-status files so a
  fresh materialisation cannot retroactively mutate already-done work
  (issue #226).

Issue #221 A8-A17 enumerated nine candidate passes; this module
implements the three most-frequently-tripped ones (A11, A12, A13) and
provides the package scaffold for the rest.

The skill's Step 5 invokes these helpers via the Bash tool, e.g.::

    uv run python -c "from workbench.plugin_helpers import \\
        backlog_post_processor as bpp; \\
        import pathlib; \\
        bpp.run_all(pathlib.Path('backlog'), \\
            scope_paths=[pathlib.Path('backlog/E17-...')])"

The returned counts are also useful for the audit-comment surface.

Scope and terminal-status guards (issue #226)
=============================================

Every pass accepts two optional arguments that control which work-unit
files it touches:

- ``scope_paths``: an iterable of ``Path`` objects naming the epic
  directories the pass may walk. ``None`` (the default) walks the full
  ``backlog_dir`` tree. When supplied, only files under those scope
  paths are considered candidates.
- ``force_terminal``: when ``False`` (the default), files whose
  ``## Status:`` line is one of the terminal states in
  ``_TERMINAL_STATUSES`` are skipped even when otherwise in scope. Set to
  ``True`` to override the guard (one-time mass migrations of an old
  backlog under a new convention).

Together, the two guards make the post-processor safe to run from a
``spec-to-backlog`` invocation that adds new epics on top of an existing
populated backlog: the operator-supplied ``scope_paths`` lists only the
newly-authored epics, and the terminal-status guard catches any stray
done / declined file the scope happened to include.

    Materialising a new spec on top of an existing backlog must preserve
    every existing E1...E16 row verbatim and only APPEND new rows for
    the epics this materialisation produced. Today the skill's Step 6
    re-writes BACKLOG.md from scratch, so the operator had to merge
    the new content into the existing file by hand.

    This pass implements append-first semantics:

    1. If ``BACKLOG.md`` does not exist at ``workspace_root / BACKLOG.md``
       (or ``workspace_root`` is ``None``), the pass returns 0 -- the
       skill falls back to its existing greenfield write path.
    2. If ``BACKLOG.md`` exists, parses the existing Status Summary and
       Full Work Unit Index. For each scope path, walks the task files
       and appends ROWS NOT ALREADY IN THE INDEX. Existing rows are
       byte-for-byte preserved.
    3. If any new epic ID collides with an existing index ID
       (different file path), raises ``BacklogAppendCollisionError``
       and writes nothing.

    Args:
        backlog_dir: Root of the backlog tree (used for scope walks).
        scope_paths: Optional iterable of epic directories to walk.
            When ``None``, walks the full ``backlog_dir`` tree.
        workspace_root: Root of the workspace -- the directory holding
            ``BACKLOG.md``. When ``None``, the pass is a no-op (the
            skill must supply the workspace root explicitly).

    The terminal-status guard does not apply to this pass: existing
    rows in BACKLOG.md are byte-for-byte preserved regardless of
    status, so there is nothing for ``force_terminal`` to override.

    Returns:
        ``1`` when ``BACKLOG.md`` was modified, ``0`` otherwise.

    Raises:
        BacklogAppendCollisionError: when a new epic ID collides with

    task-ID regex ``^E\\d+(-F\\d+)?(-S\\d+)?(-T\\d+)?$`` on the first
    column of every row in ``## Dependencies`` and ``### Depends On

    with ``dependency ID '<slug>' does not match the canonical
    task-ID regex``. This pass strips the slug suffix to leave the

    Walks the two dependency-table sections in each work-unit file:

    - ``### Depends On This`` (level-3 heading, downstream deps)
