"""Canonical `### Code Standards` block emitter for spec-to-backlog (#230).

The ``spec-to-backlog`` skill authors a `### Code Standards` block in
every leaf-task file. Across a single backlog the block is byte-for-byte
identical modulo the `#### Error Handling Contract` subsection's
task-specific entries. Re-typing the ~50-line block per task burns
authoring token cost and risks per-task wording drift when sub-agents
paraphrase rather than copy verbatim.

This module ships the canonical block as a single source-of-truth
template and exposes ``emit_code_standards_block`` that returns the
rendered block with workspace-specific and task-specific substitutions
applied. The skill (Step 5a) is expected to call this helper instead
of re-typing the boilerplate.

Workspace override
==================

Workspaces that want a customised canonical body can place a file at
``<workspace_root>/code-standards-canonical.md`` -- if present it
overrides the workbench-shipped default. The override file uses the
same placeholder tokens as the shipped default.

Placeholder tokens
==================

The template carries three replacement tokens:

- ``<WORKSPACE_CLAUDE_MD>`` -- resolved to ``<workspace_root>/CLAUDE.md``
  so the rendered block points at the workspace's local engineering
  standards file.
- ``<TASK_SPECIFIC_ERROR_PATHS>`` -- replaced by the operator-supplied
  task-specific error-path bullets (or ``(none)`` when no paths are
  supplied).
- ``<REPO_CARVE_OUTS>`` -- replaced by a rendered list of repo-specific
  carve-outs (e.g., vendored directories that mypy / bandit skip), or
  ``(none)`` when no carve-outs are supplied.

Idempotency
===========

``emit_code_standards_block(...)`` returns the same string for the same
inputs every time. The helper has no filesystem side-effects beyond
reading the optional workspace override.

# The canonical body. Operators who want to customise per-workspace
# override this by placing a ``code-standards-canonical.md`` file at
# their workspace root. The body uses the same three placeholder tokens
# documented at module-level (``<WORKSPACE_CLAUDE_MD>``,
# ``<TASK_SPECIFIC_ERROR_PATHS>``, ``<REPO_CARVE_OUTS>``).
#
# The body is authored to align with the engineering standards at
# ``/workspaces/rpm-migration/CLAUDE.md`` (the operator's source-of-truth
# for mpm-deps-work). Other workspaces can replace this body wholesale
# by shipping their own ``code-standards-canonical.md`` override.
