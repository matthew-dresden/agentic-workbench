"""CLI entry point for the workbench system.

Provides shell-callable commands so Claude Code (or any external process)
can query backlog status and bridge plugin agents to repo context.

Usage::

    python3 -m workbench.cli [--config <path>] <command> [args]

Options::

    --config <path>         Path to workbench YAML config (sets WORKBENCH_CONFIG_PATH).
                            Overrides the WORKBENCH_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

Commands::

    status                  Show backlog summary (counts by status)
    next                    Print the next actionable work unit ID and title
    claim <id>              Claim a work unit (transition to in-progress)
    set-status <id> <s>     Force any status; bulk: --include "<toks>" [--exclude "<toks>"] [--dry-run] [--yes] <s>

    mark-done <id>          Mark unit as Done (enforces done-gate: all judges must have passed)
    decline <id> --reason M Mark unit Declined (won't ever be done); captures the rationale
    hold <id> --reason M    Mark unit Hold (deferred / under debate); orchestrator skips it
    unhold <id> --reason M  Return a held unit to in-queue and capture why it was released
    validate-backlog [--fix] Check backlog integrity; --fix auto-corrects rule-10/11 violations
    ensure-branch <id>      Create or switch to work unit branch before executor runs
    git-ops <id>            Run git operations for a work unit (commit-only when defer_pr is set)
    git-ops-finalize <repo> Push single branch and create PR (after all deferred commits)
    report [since]          Print progress report with velocity stats
    log <message>           Append a message to the orchestrator log file
    start                   Run the orchestrate skill via the Claude Agent SDK (non-interactive)
    scope set/clear/show    Persistent scope management without starting the orchestrator
    watch [--watch N]       Show a live dashboard of the active orchestration

Plugin agent bridge commands (used by workbench plugin agents)::

    read-unit <id>                          Return work unit content and repo path as JSON
    get-diff <id>                           Return combined git diff for the work unit's repo
    run-tests <id>                          Run test suite for the work unit's repo
    log-verdict <judge> <id> <v> [msg]      Log a judge verdict (pass|fail) to work unit Comments
    log-comment <agent> <id> <message>      Log a non-verdict agent comment to work unit Comments
    log-tdd <id> <phase> <message>          Log a TDD phase entry (RED|GREEN|REFACTOR) to TDD Cycle Log
    request-amendment <id>                  Register amendment request (JSON payload on stdin)
    apply-amendment <id>                    Apply approved amendment with Layer 3 post-check
    reject-amendment <id> <reason>          Reject amendment and block the task
    list-proposals                          List every pending task-factory proposal
    promote-proposal <id>                   Promote a proposed task to in-queue (with dependency wiring)
    promote-proposal --all-from <src>       Promote every proposed task originating from a source task
    reject-proposal <id> --reason <msg>     Archive a proposed task's draft and remove its BACKLOG row
    materialise-proposal <src>              Materialise a pending proposal into draft files (agent-called)
    write-proposal <src>                    Persist a blocker-resolver proposal JSON read from stdin

All commands exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure. Output is structured
for easy parsing by Claude Code or other automation.

    Issue #163: streams continuously by default when stdout is a TTY.
    Pass ``once=True`` (or pipe / redirect stdout) to get the legacy
    one-shot behaviour suitable for scripts and CI consumers.

    The legacy ``--watch N`` flag is preserved for backward compatibility
    but emits a deprecation notice and falls through to the streaming
    loop (the integer interval is ignored; cadence is data-driven).

    Args:
        since: ISO-8601 UTC timestamp string; restricts the report window.
        watch_interval: Deprecated ``--watch N`` interval (ignored; streaming
            mode is always cadence-driven).  Pass ``> 0`` to trigger the
            deprecation notice and streaming fallback.
        once: When ``True``, forces one-shot rendering regardless of TTY.
        include: Raw ``--include`` token string (empty = not supplied).
        exclude: Raw ``--exclude`` token string (empty = not supplied).
        session: Named-session name from ``--session <name>`` (empty = not
            supplied, AC-192-12).  When non-empty, the report is filtered to
            that session's WUs and event-index queries read from the
            per-session log.

        ``0`` on success; ``1`` on scope-resolution error or missing session.

        cleanup-tracked-orphans <org/repo|repo-path> [--dry-run]

    Walks ``git ls-files`` in the target repo, identifies entries
    matching standard ignore patterns (terraform state, terragrunt
    cache, Python pycache, coverage, node_modules, .DS_Store), runs
    ``git rm --cached`` on each (preserving them on disk), and writes a
    workbench-managed block to the repo's root ``.gitignore`` so future
    commits cannot reintroduce the pattern.

    Pure Python implementation: invokes git via subprocess directly so
    the PreToolUse ``guard-destructive-git`` hook (which scopes only to
    Bash agent-tool calls) does not interfere.

    Override the default pattern list via
    ``WORKBENCH_ORPHAN_IGNORE_PATTERNS`` (comma-separated fnmatch globs)
    when a backlog needs different shapes.

    The repo argument accepts either an ``org/repo`` form (resolved

    ``checkout_directory``) or a direct filesystem path to a git repo.

    Loads the workbench plugin from the plugin directory adjacent to this package
    and invokes the orchestrate skill, which processes the backlog until all
    work units are complete or blocked.

    Accepts optional scope-filter flags (spec section 4.2.2, AC-190-8, AC-190-9):

    - ``--include "<tokens>"`` -- comma-separated printer-pages-style tokens.
      When supplied, ``ScopeFilter`` is built from the current backlog's WU IDs,
      persisted to ``<workspace>/.workbench/scope.json``, and the
      ``WORKBENCH_SCOPE_FILE`` env var is set to that path before the SDK run.
    - ``--exclude "<tokens>"`` -- comma-separated tokens subtracted from the
      include set.  Only meaningful together with ``--include``.

    When ``--include`` is absent or empty, all work units are eligible (current
    behavior preserved, no scope.json written).

    On clean SDK return, ``ScopeFilter.clear(workspace_root)`` is called to
    remove any active scope.json (AC-190-13).  When the SDK raises (crash
    path), scope.json is intentionally left on disk for operator inspection.

    When ``agents.*`` overrides are configured in ``workbench.yaml`` (or via
    ``JUDGE_AGENT_MODEL_*`` env vars), a workspace-local shadow plugin tree
    is materialised at ``<workspace>/.workbench/plugin-shadow/workbench/`` and
    passed to the SDK in place of the canonical plugin (ADR-25).

    On clean SDK return, inspects the backlog post-mortem: when the only
    reason the orchestrator stopped is one or more
    ``BlockedTaskState.RUNTIME_DEGRADATION`` tasks (SDK lost Agent-tool
    access mid-session) and no IN_PROGRESS / IN_REVIEW / OPERATOR_ACTION_REQUIRED
    work is pending, writes an audit line to the orchestrator log and
    returns :data:`ORCHESTRATOR_RESTART_EXIT_CODE` (42). The wrapping
    ``make start`` loop interprets that code as "auto-restart" up to its
    ``WORKBENCH_MAX_AUTO_RESTARTS`` cap. Any other exit returns 0.

    **Drain enforcement (spec section 4.3.3, AC-188-4/5/8):** Between SDK
    messages, the inner ``_run`` coroutine checks whether a ``workbench claim``
    Bash tool-use is being requested.  When one is detected AND the drain
    signal file is present, ``_run`` raises :class:`_DrainRequested`.
    ``cmd_start`` catches this sentinel, consumes the drain marker, logs a
    ``[ORCHESTRATOR_DRAIN_ENFORCED]`` audit entry, and returns 0.

    Equivalent to running ``claude --plugin-dir <plugin>`` and invoking
    the orchestrate skill interactively, but suitable for CI/unattended runs.

    Args:
        *argv: Optional flags (``--include``, ``--exclude``, ``--name``,
            ``--allow-overlap``).

    Returns:
        0 on success (including drain-enforced stop), 1 on argument-parse
        error, invalid scope token, or scope overlap without ``--allow-overlap``,
        :data:`ORCHESTRATOR_RESTART_EXIT_CODE` (42) when auto-restart is triggered.

    Raises:
        Nothing from this function's own scope -- all SDK exceptions propagate
        as-is through the asyncio boundary; :class:`_DrainRequested` is
        caught here and handled as a clean exit.

    Usage::

        add-dep <blocked-task-id> <blocker-task-id> [--reason "<audit message>"]

    Writes a Dependencies-table row and a ``[WU_WIRED] ... [BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL] <blocker>``
    audit comment on the blocked task's file. The ADR-07 auto-requeue cascade
    then auto-unblocks the task when the blocker reaches ``done`` / ``declined``.

    Used for three scenarios the ``promote-proposal`` flow does not cover:

    1. Operator realises AFTER a promote that an additional task should have
       been listed in the proposal's ``affected_task_ids``.
    2. Operator hand-authored a work unit (not via task-factory) that
       unblocks another task and wants to wire the marker without touching
       the file by hand.
    3. Operator corrects a proposal authored without ``affected_task_ids``
       retroactively.

    Fail-fast:
      - Both IDs must match the task-ID regex.
      - Blocker must exist in the backlog index.
      - Blocker must not be in a terminal state (``done`` / ``declined``).
      - Blocked must exist in the backlog index.
      - Blocked and blocker cannot be the same.

    Warns (but does not refuse) when the blocked task is not currently in
    ``blocked`` status. The cascade only fires on blocked tasks, so wiring a
    marker on an in-queue task is harmless metadata; the operator almost
    certainly meant to flip to blocked first.

    Idempotent: if either the dep row or the marker is already present, the
    corresponding write is skipped. ``wired: true`` in the output JSON means
    at least one of the two was newly written on this call; ``wired: false``
    means the call was a complete no-op.

#
# add-dep is variadic because its `--reason "<multi token message>"` flag
# value is dropped by the fixed-arity slice (slice keeps only positional
# count + 1 trailing arg, so `--reason` survives but the value after it
# does not). _parse_add_dep_argv handles flags itself; opting into
