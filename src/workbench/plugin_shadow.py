"""Materialise a workspace-local shadow plugin directory for per-agent model overrides.

When operators set ``agents.<name>: <model>`` in ``workbench.yaml`` the canonical
marketplace plugin's agent ``.md`` files cannot be edited safely (the
marketplace install is shared and treated as immutable). Instead a shadow tree
is built under ``<workspace>/.workbench/plugin-shadow/workbench/`` that mirrors
the canonical plugin via symlinks for every file except the agent ``.md``
files whose model is overridden -- those are written as plain files with the
``model:`` frontmatter line rewritten to the operator-supplied value.

Both ``cmd_start`` (non-interactive, via ``ClaudeAgentOptions(plugins=...)``)
and ``workbench prepare-plugin-shadow`` (interactive, via
``claude --plugin-dir``) point at the same materialised path, so the override
behaviour is identical across modes.

The module is intentionally small and side-effect-isolated so 100% line +
branch coverage (Makefile :: ``test-coverage-new``) is achievable.
