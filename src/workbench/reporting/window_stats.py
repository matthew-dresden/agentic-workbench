"""Per-task window-stats aggregates (#162 Phase 2).

Records every task-state transition into a per-task aggregate JSON at
``<workspace>/.workbench/window-stats/<task-id>.json`` so the reporter
can read aggregates directly -- O(task_count) -- instead of re-scanning
the orchestrator log on every invocation.

The aggregate is the structural summary of one task's lifecycle:
the timestamps it entered each state, plus a list of every transition
in order. The reporter derives durations and per-state metrics from
those timestamps; nothing else flows through this layer.

Atomic write. ``update_aggregate`` reads the existing aggregate (if
any), merges the new transition, writes to ``<task-id>.json.tmp`` in
the same directory, then ``os.replace``s atomically (POSIX same-
filesystem rename). A crash mid-write either leaves the prior file
intact or makes the new file fully present; never a torn JSON
document.

Self-healing. The aggregate is a derived view of the JSONL log; the
log is authoritative. ``rebuild_from_log`` walks the orchestrator log
and rebuilds every aggregate from scratch (used by
``workbench rebuild-window-stats`` after an upgrade or after
``.workbench/window-stats/`` has been deleted). Aggregate deletion is
always safe.

Schema versioning. The top-level ``schema_version`` lets future
workbench releases evolve the aggregate format without manual cleanup.
A version mismatch on read returns an empty aggregate, which the
caller treats as "rebuild on next transition."
