"""Pre-rendered report snapshot (#162 Phase 6).

Materialises a snapshot of the rendered ``workbench report`` output to
``<workspace>/.workbench/report-snapshot.json`` after every orchestrate-
loop iteration. ``workbench report`` can read the snapshot directly when
it is fresh -- no log parse, no per-window aggregation, no event-index
refresh -- and falls back to live aggregation through the Phase 1+4
cache when the snapshot is stale or missing.

Freshness contract. The snapshot carries the orchestrator log's
``(mtime_ns, size)`` tuple at the moment it was written. ``read_snapshot``
returns the cached report only when the current log's tuple still
matches; any change (new bytes appended, log rotated, file shrunk)
invalidates the snapshot and the caller falls back to live.

Atomic write. ``write_snapshot`` writes to ``report-snapshot.json.tmp``
in the same directory then renames atomically (POSIX same-filesystem
rename is atomic). A crash mid-write leaves either the old snapshot
intact or the new snapshot fully present -- never a torn write that
returns a corrupt JSON document.

Schema version. The top-level ``schema_version`` lets future code
invalidate snapshots from older workbench releases without manual
cleanup. A version mismatch on read returns ``None``; the caller
rebuilds via the live path on next iteration.

Self-healing. Snapshot deletion is always safe -- the next
``workbench report`` invocation rebuilds via the live aggregation path
through the Phase 1+4 cache. The snapshot is a derived view, never
the source of truth.
