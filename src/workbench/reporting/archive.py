"""Columnar cold-archive for ended orchestrator sessions (#162 Phase 7).

After an orchestrate session ends, operators can archive its log lines
to a per-session Parquet file under ``logs/legacy/<session-id>.parquet``
for long-term retention. The archive is faster to read for all-time
queries than walking thousands of JSONL lines and lighter on disk
(compressed columnar format).

Opt-in dependency. ``pyarrow`` is the only new package introduced by
this layer. It is NOT a mandatory workbench dependency -- operators who
don't archive don't install it. Install via:

    pip install agentic-workbench[archive]

When ``pyarrow`` is missing, every public function in this module
raises :class:`ArchiveDependencyMissingError` with a structured message
naming the install command. No fallback path; the operator either
installs the extra or doesn't archive (per CLAUDE.md fail-fast).

Source-of-truth contract. The JSONL log remains authoritative. The
Parquet archive is a derived view; deleting an archive is always
safe (the source JSONL still holds the events). Round-trip parity
is pinned by tests: writing a JSONL session to Parquet and reading
back produces byte-identical event records.
