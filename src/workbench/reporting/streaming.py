"""Always-on streaming reporter (issue #163).

This module wraps ``generate_report`` in a self-refreshing loop so
``workbench report`` (no flags, on a TTY) never goes blank between
refreshes and renders the next frame as soon as any source file
advances. The loop polls cache-stat tuples (mtime + size of the
orchestrator log + hook log + transcripts directory's newest file) at
a fixed cadence; renders happen ONLY on stat-key change. Idle
workspaces produce no renders and burn no CPU; active workspaces get
sub-frame refreshes.

No-blank-screen guarantee (issue #163 acceptance criterion). The
two implementation rules:

1. ``render_fn`` runs to completion BEFORE any clear escape sequence
   reaches the terminal. The new frame is captured in memory first;
   the terminal is not touched until the frame is fully built.
2. ``_clear_and_write`` issues the clear sequence and the new content
   in a single buffered ``sys.stdout.write`` followed by exactly one
   ``flush``. Two-step "clear then write" patterns are forbidden
   because they leave the terminal blank for the gap between the two
   I/O operations.

Together these guarantee the terminal flips OLD frame -> NEW frame in
one redraw cycle. Tests in ``test_streaming.py`` pin both invariants
so a regression that introduces a blank fails CI.

The render-latency footer below the report exposes the loop's pace to
the operator without instrumenting ``generate_report`` itself.
