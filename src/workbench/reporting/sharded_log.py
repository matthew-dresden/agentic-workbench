"""Sharded event-store layout (#162 Phase 3).

Partitions an accumulated orchestrator log into a date + task tree at
``<workspace>/logs/<YYYY-MM>/<task-id>.jsonl`` (plus
``<YYYY-MM>/orchestrator-meta.jsonl`` for non-task-tagged records).
Reports needing a recent window read 1 to a few small shards; reports
needing all-time read every shard but each is small.

Design choice (issue #162 minimum-viable Phase 3). The sharded tree
is a derived view of the historical log; the migration command
partitions accumulated history once. The orchestrator continues
writing to a fresh ``logs/orchestrator.log`` after migration. Readers
merge both sources transparently. This keeps the runtime
``logging.FileHandler`` untouched -- destructive surgery on the live
write path is the highest-risk change in the rollup, so this layer
doesn't take that risk. Operators can re-run the migration
periodically to absorb new accumulation into the sharded tree.

Source-of-truth contract. The pre-migration flat log is archived to
``logs/legacy/orchestrator.log`` for one release cycle. Operators can
roll back at any time by deleting ``logs/<YYYY-MM>/`` and renaming
``logs/legacy/orchestrator.log`` back to ``logs/orchestrator.log``.
The migration is reversible.

Transactional fail-safe. The migration:

1. Walks the source flat log into per-shard buffers in memory.
2. Writes each shard atomically (write-temp-then-rename).
3. Verifies the total written line count matches the source line count.
4. Atomically renames the source log to ``logs/legacy/orchestrator.log``.

Any failure before step 4 leaves the source log intact and removes the
partial sharded tree (the operator can re-run after fixing the issue).
