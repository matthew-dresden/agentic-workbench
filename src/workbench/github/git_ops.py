        Assumes the repository is already on the correct branch -- call
        :meth:`ensure_branch` before the executor agent stages files.

        This method is idempotent: it is safe to call on restart after a partial run.

        Full operation sequence:

        1. Validate *repo* against the allow-list (``validate_repo``).
        2. Validate *branch* format against ``_BRANCH_RE`` (allowlist pattern that
           rejects consecutive special characters per git ref naming rules).
        3. ``git add -A`` -- stage all working-tree changes.
        4. ``git status --porcelain`` -- check whether anything was staged.

           - If the output is **non-empty**: proceed to commit and push (steps 5-6).
           - If the output is **empty** (nothing to commit): the working tree is
             already clean, meaning a prior run completed the commit.  Skip the
             commit and evaluate whether a push is still needed:

             - Remote branch absent (``origin/<branch>`` does not exist): push.
             - Remote branch present but local HEAD differs from remote HEAD: push
               (prior run committed but push failed).
             - Remote branch present and local HEAD matches remote HEAD: skip push
               and return.  The desired state is fully achieved.

        5. ``git commit -m <message>`` -- commit staged changes (skipped when clean).
        6. ``git push origin <branch>`` -- push to the remote (skipped when remote
           is already up to date).

        All git commands are executed via :meth:`_git`, which invokes subprocess
