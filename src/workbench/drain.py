"""Drain signal helpers for workbench.

Provides the DRAIN_SIGNAL_NAME constant, DrainState dataclass, and four
helper functions to write, cancel, read, and consume the drain signal
file that the orchestrator uses to coordinate graceful shutdown.

The write path (request_drain) uses a tmp-then-rename pattern so readers
never observe a partial file. consume_drain is not POSIX-atomic (read then
unlink).

When ``WORKBENCH_SESSION_NAME`` is set, all public helpers use the per-session
drain signal path ``<workspace>/.workbench/sessions/<name>/drain.signal``
instead of the workspace-root path (spec 4.4.4, AC-192-7).  Per-session
paths are always constructed relative to the ``workspace`` argument passed to
each public helper -- no additional environment variable is required.

Raised exceptions are documented on each public function. No function
silently swallows an exception.
