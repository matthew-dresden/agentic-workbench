"""Shared subprocess utility for running shell commands.

This module provides a standalone ``run_command`` function that wraps
``subprocess.run`` with consistent error handling for missing executables
and timeouts.  It is intentionally free of judge-specific dependencies so
that non-judge components can use it without inheriting the full judge
contract.
