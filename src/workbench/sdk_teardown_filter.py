"""Narrow asyncio-loop exception handler for the known SDK teardown race (#232).

``claude_agent_sdk._internal.query.Query.close()`` raises
``RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than
it was entered in`` during session teardown -- AFTER the final
``ResultMessage`` has been yielded and the orchestration outcome is
already established. The exception is raised in a background task
(asyncio.Task) that the consumer never retrieves, so Python's asyncio
default exception handler logs it as
``[asyncio] ERROR Task exception was never retrieved`` followed by the
full traceback.

Workbench's consumer (cmd_start in cli.py) cannot catch this via a
normal ``try / except`` around the ``async for`` loop -- the exception
fires on a different task. The asyncio-loop exception-handler API
(``loop.set_exception_handler``) is the only intercept point.

This module installs a narrow filter that:

1. Inspects the asyncio context dict.
2. If the exception is a ``RuntimeError`` whose message contains the
   exact known marker substring AND the traceback walks through a
   ``claude_agent_sdk/_internal/`` frame, the filter logs ONE WARNING
   line on the ``workbench.sdk`` logger naming the upstream-tracking
   issue (matthew-dresden/agentic-workbench#231) and the full traceback at
   DEBUG so the diagnostic is preserved.
3. Otherwise, delegates to the previously-installed handler so
   unrelated asyncio defects still surface at ERROR.

The match is intentionally narrow (per CLAUDE.md "Fail-Fast
Philosophy"): a future SDK release that changes the message string or
the module layout will fall through to the default handler and
surface as ERROR -- which is correct (it would mean a different,
unknown SDK defect).

Tracking issue (upstream + downstream):

- matthew-dresden/agentic-workbench#231 -- stays open until upstream fixes.
- matthew-dresden/agentic-workbench#232 -- this workaround; closes when this
  module lands on ``feat/issues-188-193``.
- anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python#983 -- upstream bug.
