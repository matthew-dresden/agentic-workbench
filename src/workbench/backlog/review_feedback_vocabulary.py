"""Per-judge controlled vocabulary for review-judge rejection feedback.

Issue #156: every review-judge rejection JSON written via
``cmd_log_rejection_feedback`` must use category codes from the judge's
fixed vocabulary. Layer 1 schema validation rejects any code not in the
corresponding judge's set; the executor / done-gate / status panel /
report all key off these tokens.

The literal strings are part of the public contract -- agents emit them,
the executor resolves them, and the report aggregates them. Adding a new
code is a backlog change; renaming or removing one is breaking.

The ``manifest_amender`` set mirrors ``AMENDER_REJECTION_CATEGORIES``
from ``workbench.backlog.amendment`` so the legacy amender path and the
new shared review-failures path share a single taxonomy.
