"""Backlog manager that updates work-unit statuses and traceability.

Owns the backlog lifecycle: status writes, done-gate checks, rollups,
comments, backlog validation, and traceability logging.

Public API
----------
``force_status``              -- write any status to both files with no gate
                                checks.  Use for automated lifecycle transitions
                                (in-progress, in-review) and manual recovery.
``mark_done``                 -- gated completion: verifies all required review
                                judges passed before writing ``done``.
``mark_blocked``              -- writes ``blocked`` and appends a reason comment.
``bulk_set_status``           -- set one status on many WUs under a single
                                flock(BACKLOG.lock); writes a workspace-level
                                ``[BULK_STATUS_UPDATE]`` audit row per call.
``validate``                  -- returns integrity errors (missing files, status
                                drift, orphans, broken deps, summary mismatch).
``log_to_traceability_matrix``-- appends a spec/test mapping entry to the
                                traceability matrix file.
``_append_tdd_entry``         -- appends a timestamped TDD phase entry to the
                                ``## TDD Cycle Log`` section of a work-unit file.

Constructor
-----------
``BacklogManager(logger=None)``
    Accepts an optional ``logging.Logger`` instance.  Defaults to
    ``logging.getLogger("workbench.backlog_manager")`` when omitted.

All writes go through the private ``_set_status`` workhorse which updates
both the work-unit file and BACKLOG.md atomically.  After each write,
``_set_status`` calls the private ``_update_status_summary`` helper to keep
the ``## Status Summary`` table in sync.

# (non-terminal), preventing the cascade from firing even when the real marker
# target (e.g. E5-F3-S1-T4) was terminal. The fix narrows the pattern to only

        cascades upward (child done -> parent done), this cascade runs
        sideways (dep done -> blocked dependent requeued).

        Narrow trigger. A blocked candidate is auto-requeued only when ALL
        of the following hold:

        1. Its status is ``blocked`` (non-blocked candidates are skipped).
        2. The just-completed task (``newly_done_id``) appears EITHER in the
           candidate's declared Dependencies table OR as a
           ``[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]`` marker ID in the Comments section.
           Issue #200 / AC-200-2: the marker-only path was previously missing,
           causing tasks whose only reference to the promoted dep was via a
           marker (no Dependencies-table row) to stay blocked indefinitely.
        3. The candidate's Comments section carries at least one
           ``[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]`` marker.
        4. Every task ID named by those markers is in a terminal state
           (``done`` or ``declined``). Unknown IDs (e.g. rejected proposals
           no longer in the index) count as non-terminal so the cascade
           stays conservative.

        Tasks that block for other reasons (review failure, git-ops error,
        operator intervention) never carry the marker and stay manual. The
        transition uses :meth:`force_status` and writes an ``[AUTO_UNBLOCKED]``
        audit comment naming every marker ID.

        The scan operates directly on ``_parse_backlog_rows`` output (the
        same lightweight tuple-based view ``_rollup_parent_status`` uses)
        rather than the full ``BacklogParser.parse_index`` object model,

        Issue #208 (companion to issue #147). The marker cascade in
        :meth:`_auto_requeue_marker_dependents` only handles blocked tasks
        carrying a ``[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]`` marker. Tasks that landed
        in ``blocked`` via ``cmd_sync_blocked`` (regular Dependencies-table
        deps unsatisfied, no marker) were marooned: even after the dep
        transitioned to ``done``, the task stayed blocked indefinitely. An
        operator had to run ``workbench sync-blocked`` or
        ``workbench reconcile-cascade`` manually.

        Narrow trigger. A blocked candidate is auto-requeued only when ALL
        of the following hold:

        1. Its status is ``blocked``.
        2. It carries NO ``[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]`` marker (those are
           owned by the marker cascade -- double-handling would produce
           conflicting audit comments).
        3. The just-completed task (``newly_done_id``) appears in its
           declared Dependencies table.
        4. Every other entry in its Dependencies table is in a terminal
           state (``done`` or ``declined``).

        The transition uses :meth:`force_status` and writes a single
        ``[UNBLOCKED] [CASCADE_RESOLVED]`` audit comment naming the dep
        whose completion triggered the cascade. The supersession audit
        shape mirrors the marker cascade and ``cmd_sync_blocked`` so the
        status-panel renderer treats all three uniformly (#153).

        Args:
