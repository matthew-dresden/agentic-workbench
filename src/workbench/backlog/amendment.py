"""Manifest amendment lifecycle: request, apply, reject with Layer 3 post-check.

When an executor stages a file outside the declared Changes Manifest, it
emits an amendment request JSON. A judge reviews the request and either
approves it (invoking ``apply_amendment``) or rejects it (invoking
``reject_amendment``).

``apply_amendment`` is atomic with rollback: it snapshots the work-unit
Markdown file, appends the requested rows plus an audit comment, writes
the result atomically via temp-file-plus-rename, runs the Layer 3
deterministic post-check, and on any post-check failure restores the
original content. Structural damage cannot survive an apply even if the
judge approved.

Layer 3 post-checks (all deterministic):

- Updated Changes Manifest re-parses cleanly.
- No em-dash (U+2014) introduced anywhere in the updated work-unit file.
- ``BacklogManager.validate`` still returns zero errors against the full
  backlog (this catches BACKLOG.md / file status drift, orphan references,
  status-summary counts, and every other existing integrity rule).

Pre-filter checks (schema, task state, file-in-diff, etc.) live in
``cmd_request_amendment`` in the CLI layer and in ``apply_amendment`` /
``reject_amendment`` themselves. Additional comprehensive pre-filter
checks are added by later slices of this feature.
