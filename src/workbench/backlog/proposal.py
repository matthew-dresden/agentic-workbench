"""Task-factory proposal lifecycle.

After the manifest-amender rejects an amendment whose changes are legitimate
production fixes outside the task's scope, the orchestrator invokes
``workbench-orchestrate:blocker-resolver`` which writes a proposal JSON file describing
one or more new work units the factory should generate. ``workbench-orchestrate:task-factory``
then materialises each proposed task as a draft ``.md`` file with a status
determined by ``backlog.default_status_for_new_work_units`` in
``backlog/config/workbench.yaml`` (default: ``in-queue``; ``draft`` when opted in
via AC-189-8) and inserts a row in ``BACKLOG.md``. The human reviews, edits,
and promotes (``workbench promote-proposal``) or rejects
(``workbench reject-proposal``) each draft.

All mutations live in this module so the CLI layer stays thin. Concurrency
is protected by a POSIX file lock on ``.workbench/task-factory.lock``:
``allocate_next_ids`` acquires the lock before scanning the story directory
and returning a contiguous sequence of free task IDs. Two factory runs
firing in parallel cannot produce colliding IDs.
