# guard-work-unit-write.sh -- PreToolUse hook: block Write/Edit to work unit .md files.
#
# Receives JSON on stdin with structure:
#   { "tool_name": "Write"|"Edit", "tool_input": { "file_path": "...", "content": "..." } }
#
# Blocks writes to files matching backlog/**/*.md (work unit files).
# Allows:
#   - Files outside backlog/
#   - BACKLOG.md (top-level tracking index, managed separately)
#   - backlog/config/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md and other non-.md files in backlog/
#   - Non-.md files anywhere under backlog/
#
# For Write/Edit calls targeting backlog/**/*.md, also validates content:
#   Rule 10: rejects content containing an em-dash (U+2014).
#   Rule 11: rejects content whose Changes Manifest table rows or Source: lines
#            are prefixed with a known checkout_directory from workbench.yaml.
#
# Work unit .md files are managed exclusively by the orchestrate skill.
# Executor agents must not modify them directly.
#
# Exit 0  -> operation is allowed (Claude proceeds)
# Exit 2  -> operation is blocked (stderr becomes Claude's feedback)

# when the caller's cwd does not declare a `python` entry in `.tool-versions`,
# which is true for every test fixture using a tmp_path workspace and for any
# operator running this hook from a directory without an asdf python pin. The
# old behaviour silently swallowed the asdf exit, leaving CONTENT empty and
# bypassing rules 10 + 11 -- a real-bug source. Fix: prepend /usr/bin so the
# system python3 (always present on Linux dev containers / CI) wins resolution.
