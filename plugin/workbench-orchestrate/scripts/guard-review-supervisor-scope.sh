# guard-review-supervisor-scope.sh -- PreToolUse hook: enforce read-only

# Receives JSON on stdin (Claude Code PreToolUse contract):
#   { "tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": { "command": "..." },
#     "agent_type": "workbench-orchestrate:review-supervisor", ... }
#
# A reviewer's job is to AUDIT the diff and DELEGATE via the Agent tool.
# It MUST NOT mutate worktree, index, or filesystem state. The
# review-supervisor.md prompt instructs only Agent invocations and
# `uv run workbench log-comment` / `log-verdict` calls. Any other
# state-changing Bash command (file deletion, git mutation, redirection
# to disk) is out of scope and is rejected here.
#
# This hook is a no-op for any agent_type other than
# "workbench-orchestrate:review-supervisor"; main-session and other-agent Bash calls
# are unaffected.
#
# Override mechanism (operator-only):
#   Set WORKBENCH_ALLOW_REVIEW_SUPERVISOR_MUTATIONS=1 in the environment
#   to bypass this guard for one call. Override is logged with the matched
#   pattern + full command for an auditable trail.
#
# Exit 0  -> allowed (Claude proceeds)
# Exit 2  -> blocked (stderr becomes Claude's feedback)
