#
# Validation rules:
#   - verdict must be 'pass' or 'fail'
#   - judge name must be a known identifier
#   - feedback must be non-empty when verdict is 'fail'
#
# Passthroughs (exit 0 without validating):
#   - any '--help' / '-h' anywhere after 'log-verdict' → let the CLI print help
#   - shell meta-tokens (|, >, 2>&1, etc.) end the positional-arg window so
#     redirections and pipes are not mistaken for judge/unit_id/verdict args
#
# Exit 0  → allowed (Claude proceeds)
# Exit 2  → blocked (stderr becomes Claude's feedback)
