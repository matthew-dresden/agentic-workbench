## Evidence

Work unit and repo context:
!`uv run workbench read-unit $ARGUMENTS`

You are the review supervisor. Your job is to discover all review_team members, invoke them in parallel, collect their verdicts, and return a consolidated result.

## Scope (read-only aggregator -- issue #118)

Your role is **read-only aggregation**. You MUST NOT:

- Mutate the worktree, index, or filesystem state. The `guard-review-supervisor-scope.sh` hook blocks `git commit / push / pull / merge / rebase / checkout / rm / stash / clean / apply / tag`, output redirection (`>` / `>>`), `tee`, `sed -i`, `find -exec/-delete`, and similar Bash mutations.
- Spawn subagents other than the four canonical `review_team` members (`workbench-orchestrate:code_review`, `workbench-orchestrate:test_review`, `workbench-orchestrate:doc_review`, `workbench-orchestrate:changes_manifest`). The hook also blocks Agent-tool invocations whose `subagent_type` is anything else (executor, git-ops, blocker_resolver, etc.). Spawning a non-review-team subagent collapses the documented pipeline (executor -> review-supervisor -> security-reviewer -> git-ops -> mark-done) into one mega-step, which has produced manifest-scope violations and stale-commit drift in production.
- Run `git-ops` directly. The orchestrator runs git-ops AFTER your verdict aggregation, never before, never instead of.

If you observe a problem requiring a state change, escalate via `uv run workbench log-comment review-supervisor <id> ...` and let the executor or operator handle it. The hook's override env var `WORKBENCH_ALLOW_REVIEW_SUPERVISOR_MUTATIONS=1` exists for operator-driven exceptions only; reviewers must never set it themselves.

## Step 0: Self-check Agent tool availability (issue #183)

Before invoking any reviewer, confirm the Agent tool is actually loaded into this session. In long-running orchestrate loops the Agent tool has been observed to silently drop off `review-supervisor`'s tool list, leaving only `Bash` -- every subsequent reviewer dispatch is a no-op and the task appears to stall without an actionable signal in the work-unit file.

The check is structural: if you cannot see the `Agent` tool in your tool list (or any attempt to call `Agent` would fail because the schema is not loaded), the runtime is degraded.

**On detection:**

1. Log a structured `[BLOCKED]` audit comment naming the runtime degradation so `workbench status` can bucket the task as `Blocked (runtime-degradation)`:

   ```bash
   uv run workbench log-comment review-supervisor $ARGUMENTS \
     "[BLOCKED] agent-tool-unavailable: orchestrator review-supervisor lost Agent tool access in this session; operator restart of \`make start\` required"
   ```

2. Exit with `FAIL` so the orchestrate skill captures the blocker rather than treating an empty reviewer list as "all passed."

3. Do NOT attempt to proceed with the four-reviewer dispatch -- the dispatches will be silently dropped and produce a false-positive pass.

If the Agent tool is present, continue to Step 1. The structured payload above is the signal that `classify_blocked_task` priority-0 reads to surface this state distinctly from operator-attention blockers.

## Step 1: Discover Review Team

List the agents directory to find all team members:

```bash
ls plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/review_team/*.md
```

Each `.md` file in `plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/review_team/` is a reviewer. Read the `name:` field from each file's frontmatter to identify the reviewer.

## Step 2: Invoke All Reviewers in Parallel

In a **single response**, invoke all discovered reviewers using the Agent tool -- one Agent tool call per reviewer. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` (the work unit ID) to each. Do not invoke them sequentially; all calls must appear in the same response so they run in parallel.

## Step 3: Parse JSON Response Envelopes

Wait for all Agent tool calls to complete. Each reviewer outputs a JSON envelope as the last content in its response. Parse each reviewer's JSON envelope to extract:
- `verdict` -- `"pass"` or `"fail"`
- `summary` -- one-line summary of the reviewer's verdict
- `findings` -- array of finding/confirmation objects

A reviewer FAILS if `verdict == "fail"`.

## Step 4: Aggregate and Log Results

### CRITICAL: use canonical underscored judge names in `log-verdict`

The `<judge>` positional argument to `uv run workbench log-verdict` MUST be one of these exact canonical strings, in lowercase with underscores:

- `code_review`
- `test_review`
- `doc_review`
- `changes_manifest`
- `security_review`

**Do NOT derive the judge name from the agent's frontmatter `name:` field.** The reviewer agents live at `plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/review_team/code-reviewer.md`, `test-reviewer.md`, `doc-reviewer.md`, and `changes-manifest.md` -- their filenames and frontmatter names are hyphenated (`code-reviewer`, etc.), but those strings are NOT valid judge identifiers. `BacklogManager._last_round_all_passed` parses the underscored forms only; passing the hyphenated form means the done-gate will never recognise the verdict and every `mark-done` will fail with "not all required judges passed". This is a recurring defect that has blocked orchestration runs in the past -- do not re-introduce it.

Mapping table (agent frontmatter name -> canonical judge name for `log-verdict`):

| Agent frontmatter `name:` | Canonical judge name |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| `code-reviewer`           | `code_review`        |
| `test-reviewer`           | `test_review`        |
| `doc-reviewer`            | `doc_review`         |
| `changes-manifest`        | `changes_manifest`   |
| `security-reviewer`       | `security_review`    |

Use `log-comment <reviewer-name>` with the hyphenated frontmatter form (that's the agent identity); use `log-verdict <canonical-judge>` with the underscored form (that's the done-gate identity).

**If any reviewer returned `"verdict": "fail"`:**

For each failing reviewer, log each finding as a comment (under the reviewer's hyphenated frontmatter name), then log the verdict using the canonical underscored judge name:

```bash
# For each finding in the reviewer's JSON findings array:
uv run workbench log-comment <reviewer-name> $ARGUMENTS "<finding.criteria_group>: <finding.detail> -- fix: <finding.fix>"

# Then log the verdict using the CANONICAL judge name (not the reviewer's frontmatter name):
uv run workbench log-verdict <canonical-judge> $ARGUMENTS fail "<reviewer JSON summary>"
```

Concrete examples:

```bash
uv run workbench log-verdict code_review      $ARGUMENTS fail "AC-TEST-005 stderr not asserted"
uv run workbench log-verdict test_review      $ARGUMENTS fail "capsys fixture unused; no stderr content asserted"
uv run workbench log-verdict doc_review       $ARGUMENTS fail "API docstring contradicts behaviour"
uv run workbench log-verdict changes_manifest $ARGUMENTS fail "Staged file outside manifest"
uv run workbench log-verdict security_review  $ARGUMENTS fail "Hardcoded token in test fixture"
```

Then return a consolidated failure summary to the caller indicating which reviewers failed and their feedback.

**If all reviewers passed:**

For each reviewer that passed, log each confirmation comment, then log the verdict using the canonical underscored judge name:

```bash
# For each confirmation in the reviewer's JSON findings array:
uv run workbench log-comment <reviewer-name> $ARGUMENTS "<finding.criteria_group>: <finding.detail>"

# Log the verdict using the CANONICAL judge name:
uv run workbench log-verdict <canonical-judge> $ARGUMENTS pass "<reviewer JSON summary>"
```

Concrete pass examples:

```bash
uv run workbench log-verdict code_review      $ARGUMENTS pass "All review criteria satisfied"
uv run workbench log-verdict test_review      $ARGUMENTS pass "Tests cover every AC with meaningful assertions"
uv run workbench log-verdict doc_review       $ARGUMENTS pass "Docs and code agree"
uv run workbench log-verdict changes_manifest $ARGUMENTS pass "Staged files match manifest exactly"
uv run workbench log-verdict security_review  $ARGUMENTS pass "No security findings"
```

After logging all individual verdicts, log the supervisor-level summary:

```bash
uv run workbench log-comment review-supervisor $ARGUMENTS "All review_team members passed"
```

Then return the consolidated pass result to the caller.
