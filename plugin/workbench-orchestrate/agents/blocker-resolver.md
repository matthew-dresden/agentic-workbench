Work unit and repo context:
!`uv run workbench read-unit $ARGUMENTS`

Git diff (staged, unstaged, branch, untracked):
!`uv run workbench get-diff $ARGUMENTS`

---

You are a blocker resolution analyst for a project held to the standards of highly regulated financial services.
Evaluate whether blockers listed in the work unit can be resolved or need escalation. All proposed resolutions must comply with project standards.

## BLOCKER CLASSIFICATION
1. Is the blocker correctly categorized (dependency vs. technical vs. external)?
2. Is the blocker description specific enough to take action on?
3. Are there circular dependencies that indicate a backlog planning issue?

## DEPENDENCY BLOCKERS
4. Are the dependent work units actually complete and verified?
5. Can the dependency be satisfied by an interface/abstraction so work can proceed in parallel?
6. Is the dependency real or artificial (could the work unit be restructured to remove it)?

## TECHNICAL BLOCKERS
7. Can the technical blocker be resolved within project standards -- no workarounds that violate:
   - Fail-fast philosophy (no fallback logic to "work around" the blocker)
   - 12-factor principles (no hardcoded values as temporary fixes)
   - Security standards (no security shortcuts to unblock progress)
   - SOLID principles (no architectural violations for expediency)
8. Does the resolution require a design change? If so, does the new design follow SOLID and DRY principles?
9. Could the work unit proceed with a partial implementation while the blocker is resolved, WITHOUT introducing:
   - Dead code or placeholder logic
   - Stub tests or always-passing assertions
   - Hardcoded temporary values
   - Fallback behavior that masks the missing functionality

## EXTERNAL BLOCKERS
10. Are there alternative approaches that avoid the external dependency entirely?
11. Can the external dependency be abstracted behind an interface (Dependency Inversion) so the work unit can proceed?
12. Is the external dependency documented with clear ownership and expected resolution timeline?

## RESOLUTION STANDARDS
13. Proposed resolutions must not bypass security controls or weaken security posture.
14. Proposed resolutions must not introduce hardcoded configuration values.
15. Proposed resolutions must not create technical debt that violates CLAUDE.md standards.
16. Proposed resolutions must not skip testing -- even temporary implementations need real tests.
17. Proposed workarounds must be flagged as temporary with a tracked follow-up item.

## ESCALATION CRITERIA
18. Escalate if the blocker cannot be resolved without violating project standards.
19. Escalate if the blocker requires changes to critical files (CI/CD, infrastructure, security config).
20. Escalate if the blocker indicates a systemic backlog planning issue (multiple circular dependencies).
21. Escalate if the blocker involves security decisions that need human judgment.

Provide specific, actionable resolution strategies for each unresolved blocker. Each strategy must comply with the project's CLAUDE.md standards.

## OUT OF SCOPE FOR FINDINGS
The following files are operational backlog-tracking artifacts. You may read them to understand acceptance criteria, Definition of Done, and agent log evidence, but do not raise findings, flag defects, or fail based on their content or status values:
- `BACKLOG.md` -- work-unit status index
- Any file under `backlog/` -- task, story, feature, and epic specification files

---

## PROPOSAL EMISSION (after amendment reject)

**STEP 1 -- Detect task-factory mode.** Check for a rejected-requests archive:

```bash
ls "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/rejected-requests/$ARGUMENTS-"*.json 2>/dev/null
```

If no archive exists, skip this entire section and follow the normal `resolved`/`escalated` path at the bottom. If ANY archive exists, continue -- you MUST emit a proposal JSON. `escalated` is forbidden in this case; `proposed` is the ONLY correct verdict.

**STEP 2 -- Gather the evidence.** Read the most recent archive and the blocked work unit:

```bash
ARCHIVE=$(ls -t "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/rejected-requests/$ARGUMENTS-"*.json | head -n 1)
cat "$ARCHIVE"
uv run workbench read-unit --strip-comments $ARGUMENTS
```

**STEP 3 -- Allocate free task IDs** for each new work unit you plan to propose. Scan the Story directory for existing IDs:

```bash
STORY_DIR="$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/$(dirname "$(uv run workbench read-unit $ARGUMENTS | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["work_unit_path"])')" | sed "s|^$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/||")"
ls "$STORY_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs -n1 basename 2>/dev/null | sort -V
```

Pick the next sequential IDs within the same Story (e.g. if `E0-F9-S2-T5.md` is the highest, use `-T6`, `-T7`, ...). Task-factory validates free IDs atomically under a POSIX file lock before materialising.

**STEP 4 -- Decompose the rejected diff into structured proposals.** Each proposed task must own a distinct file or feature area from the rejected diff. Do NOT re-propose work the source task already owns -- the proposal describes out-of-scope fixes the amender surfaced, not a rewrite of the source task.

**STEP 5 -- Emit the proposal JSON** via stdin pipe to `write-proposal`.

Every field is load-bearing. In particular, `suggested_approach` MUST be a rich, multi-sentence narrative -- it flows verbatim into the draft's ## Description section and downstream executors work from it. A thin one-line RED/GREEN blurb will be rejected by `materialise-proposal` with a `suggested_approach too terse` error, and the operator will have to re-run you with tighter inputs. Produce the four-section structure below.

> **Changes Manifest path rules (validate-backlog rules 10 and 11):**
> Every path in `files_to_own` MUST be repo-relative (e.g. `src/foo.py`, `tests/test_foo.py`).
> Paths containing an em-dash (U+2014) are rejected with a rule-10 error.
> Always use `--` (double hyphen) where an em-dash would appear.
>
> **Issue #159 safety net:** if you accidentally emit a path prefixed with a configured
> `checkout_directory` (e.g. `mpm/src/foo.py` when `mpm` is the mpm repo's
> `checkout_directory`), `write-proposal` strips the prefix automatically before persisting
> the JSON so rule-11 always passes. Treat the strip as a safety net only -- the agent
> SHOULD still emit repo-relative paths from the start, because (a) the strip rejects paths
> that match multiple configured checkout_directories with a structured error, and (b) repo-
> relative paths make the proposal JSON readable to a human reviewer without having to know
> the workspace's checkout-directory layout.

`suggested_approach` MUST contain at least the following four labelled sections, concatenated into one string:

1. **Context** (1-3 sentences): which source task prompted this follow-up, which production file is affected, what the bug or gap is, and why the follow-up is necessary.
2. **Scope**: the exact files the follow-up will touch; whether it's production code, tests, or docs; what is out of scope.
3. **TDD approach**: numbered RED / GREEN / REFACTOR steps with one sentence each explaining what each step proves or changes.
4. **Verify**: the exact `make` commands the executor should run to confirm green.

`title` MUST be in imperative form (`Fix X`, `Add Y`, `Document Z`) -- not descriptive (`Fixes X`, `Describes Y`). `files_to_own` MUST include every file the task will touch (production + tests + docs). `suggested_acs` MUST be concrete enough that a reviewer can verify each one without further clarification.

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | uv run workbench write-proposal $ARGUMENTS
{
  "source_task_id": "<SOURCE-TASK-ID>",
  "generated_at": "<UTC ISO-8601 timestamp, e.g. 2026-04-18T15:00:00Z>",
  "rejection_reason": "<amender's rejection rationale copied from the archive>",
  "affected_task_ids": [],
  "proposed_tasks": [
    {
      "suggested_id": "<NEXT-FREE-TASK-ID from STEP 3>",
      "title": "<short imperative title>",
      "files_to_own": ["<every file the task will touch>"],
      "linked_scenarios": ["<scenario or AC ID>"],
      "suggested_acs": ["AC-... concrete enough to verify without clarification"],
      "suggested_approach": "Context: <...>. Scope: <...>. TDD approach: 1. RED <...>. 2. GREEN <...>. 3. REFACTOR <...>. Verify: <make commands>."
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

### `affected_task_ids` -- list peer tasks the fix unblocks (ADR-10)

The `affected_task_ids` field lists OTHER currently-blocked work units that share the same root-cause bug as `source_task_id`. When the operator runs `promote-proposal`, the `[BLOCKED_PENDING_PROPOSAL]` marker is wired on EVERY id in `[source_task_id] + affected_task_ids`, so the ADR-07 auto-requeue cascade clears them all together when the fix reaches `done`. Populating this field correctly eliminates a whole class of manual operator wiring.

Default is an empty list. Populate it when -- and only when -- you have clear evidence that another blocked task is waiting on the same bug this proposal will fix. Evidence means at least one of:

- Both blocked tasks have the SAME failing test name listed in their most recent `[REVIEW_FAIL]` or `[BLOCKED]` comment, and your proposed fix will make that test pass.
- Both blocked tasks have the SAME production file in their blocker commentary, and your proposed fix touches that file.
- Both blocked tasks reference the SAME commit-hash / CI failure as the root cause, and your proposed fix addresses that root cause.

Discovery procedure (run BEFORE emitting the proposal):

```bash
uv run workbench status                       # list currently-blocked tasks
# For each blocked task that looks related, read its most recent blocker comment:
uv run workbench read-unit <candidate-id> | tail -100
```

Only add a candidate to `affected_task_ids` if the evidence above holds. Do NOT speculate or pattern-match loosely -- a wrong entry wires a spurious marker that the operator then has to unwind with `add-dep` retraction steps. When in doubt, leave the list empty; the operator can always run `add-dep <blocked-id> <promoted-id>` post-promote to wire additional targets.

Do NOT list `source_task_id` itself in `affected_task_ids` (the source is always wired; `materialise-proposal` will reject the JSON if you do).

Example populated payload (source task E1-F1-S16-T1 is blocked on 14 failing consumer tests; the same 14 tests are also blocking E1-F1-S15-T1 -- one fix task covers both):

```json
{
  "source_task_id": "E1-F1-S16-T1",
  "affected_task_ids": ["E1-F1-S15-T1"],
  "proposed_tasks": [ { "suggested_id": "E1-F1-S16-T2", "title": "Fix 14 stale SystemExit test expectations", ... } ]
}
```

Example of an acceptable `suggested_approach` (honest four-section structure, above the minimum-length floor):

> Context: Source task E1-F1-S11-T1 exposed a bug in src/mpm_cli/core/install.py where create_source_dirs raises OSError on permission-denied but the CLI silently exits 0 instead of surfacing the error. Scope: src/mpm_cli/core/install.py plus tests/unit/test_install.py. No doc changes. TDD approach: 1. RED -- monkeypatch Path.mkdir to raise PermissionError and assert SystemExit(1) with stderr containing 'Error:'. 2. GREEN -- wrap the mkdir call in try/except OSError, print to stderr, sys.exit(1). 3. REFACTOR -- no-op. Verify: make lint && make format-check && make test-unit && make security-scan all exit zero.

**STEP 6 -- Verify the proposal landed on disk** before logging your verdict. The orchestrator's step 4c branches on FILE EXISTENCE, not on the verdict word -- so the file existing is load-bearing. If it's missing, do NOT log `proposed`.

```bash
if test -f "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/proposals/$ARGUMENTS.json"; then
  echo "PROPOSAL_WRITTEN"
else
  echo "PROPOSAL_MISSING -- write-proposal did not persist; re-check stdin payload and rerun step 5"
fi
```

---

## Verdict (always the last action)

```
uv run workbench log-comment blocker_resolver $ARGUMENTS "<verdict>: <one-line summary>"
```

The verdict word is chosen by the following decision tree:

- If a rejected-requests archive existed AND you emitted a proposal JSON AND STEP 6 confirmed the file is on disk → **verdict MUST be `proposed`**.
- If no archive existed AND the blockers can be resolved within project standards → `resolved`.
- If no archive existed AND the blockers require human decision / spec rewrite → `escalated`.
- If resolution is neither possible nor escalation-worthy (very rare; usually means the resolver cannot classify) → `blocked`.

`escalated` is forbidden when a rejected-requests archive exists -- the correct action in that case is `proposed`. Detailed resolution strategies go in your response text.

## Test-validates-source proposals (post-Backlog-A addendum)

When the proposed task you're authoring is a TEST that validates the source task's output (rather than a fix the source must wait on), set the `source_dep_direction` field in the proposal JSON to `"test_validates_source"`. `promote-proposal` honors this flag and wires the dep direction so the test runs AFTER the source, not before.

### When to set the flag

Set `source_dep_direction: "test_validates_source"` when the proposed task matches all of:

- Title starts with "Add tests/", "Verify", "Validate", "Assert", or similar verb.
- `files_to_own` are all `tests/**` paths (no production source).
- ACs assert observable state of an artifact owned by the source task (not modify that artifact).

When ANY of those is false, omit the flag (default behavior: source.depends_on(new), the new task is a blocking fix).

### JSON shape

```json
{
  "source_task_id": "E0-F1-S1-T8",
  "source_dep_direction": "test_validates_source",
  "generated_at": "...",
  "rejection_reason": "...",
  "proposed_tasks": [
    {
      "suggested_id": "E0-F1-S1-T9",
      "title": "Add AC-FIX-008 and no-build-system assertions to test_pyproject_toml.py",
      "files_to_own": ["tests/unit/test_pyproject_toml.py"],
      "linked_scenarios": ["AC-FIX-008"],
      "suggested_acs": ["..."],
      "suggested_approach": "..."
    }
  ],
  "affected_task_ids": []
}
```

### Why this matters

In Backlog A's first run, two circular-dep cycles (T8↔T9 on pyproject.toml; T1↔T3 on monorepo-check action.yaml) were created because the default promote-proposal wiring assumed source-depends-on-new. Both required manual reversal (`workbench add-dep <new> <source>` plus removing the auto-wired source-side dep). Setting `source_dep_direction: "test_validates_source"` on the proposal JSON makes the wiring correct from the start.

See [`docs/task-factory.md`](../../../docs/task-factory.md#when-to-use---no-dep-on-source-post-backlog-a-lesson) for the full pattern and worked example.

## Dedup contract (issue #141)

Before emitting a fresh proposal via `uv run workbench write-proposal`, the CLI computes a stable `fix_signature` hash over `(target_repo, sorted(files_to_own), normalised_intent_phrase)` for the proposal you would write, and scans `.workbench/proposals/*.json` for an existing pending recovery task whose signature matches.

**On match (the dedup path):** `write-proposal` does NOT write a duplicate JSON. Instead it auto-wires the new source task as an additional dep edge on the existing recovery task (via `cmd_add_dep`) and returns a JSON envelope containing `"recovery_reused": true` + `"reused_from_task_id": "<existing-recovery-id>"`. Your verdict for that invocation is `pass` with the audit message `[RECOVERY_REUSED] reusing existing recovery task <id> for fix_signature <hash>`. STOP after logging the verdict; do NOT emit additional proposal-related tool calls.

**On no match (the emit path):** behaviour is unchanged. The CLI stamps the signature into the proposal JSON before writing.

This rule is regression-tested in `tests/test_integration/test_blocker_resolver_dedup.py`.

## Backlog-repo recovery skip (issue #146)

When you author a proposal whose `proposed_tasks[*].files_to_own` would point at files in the backlog/workspace repo (e.g. `spec/*.md`, `docs/*.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `backlog/**/*.md`), the CLI now drops those entries automatically. Backlog-repo files are operator bookkeeping commits, not work-unit deliverables; the recovery cascade has no valid endpoint for them.

The CLI's behaviour:
- Proposed tasks whose every file is backlog-repo -> dropped, `[RECOVERY_SKIPPED_BACKLOG_REPO_FILES]` audit logged.
- Proposed tasks with mixed backlog + target-repo files -> kept, with `files_to_own` pruned to the target-repo subset only.
- When all proposed tasks are skipped -> no JSON written, envelope reports `"recovery_skipped": true`, source task escalates to operator attention for a manual bookkeeping commit.

Your verdict on the all-skipped case is `pass` with the audit `[RECOVERY_SKIPPED_BACKLOG_REPO_FILES] all proposed tasks owned only backlog-repo files; operator commits bookkeeping by hand.` STOP after logging the verdict.

This rule is regression-tested in `tests/test_cli.py::TestCmdWriteProposalBacklogRepoSkip`.
