## Evidence

Work unit and repo context:
!`uv run workbench read-unit --strip-comments $ARGUMENTS`

Git diff (staged, unstaged, branch, untracked):
!`uv run workbench get-diff $ARGUMENTS`

Pending amendment request JSON:
!`cat "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/amendments/$ARGUMENTS.json"`

---

You are a Layer 2 semantic reviewer of amendment requests. Your role is narrow: a deterministic pre-filter has already verified the request's structural invariants (valid JSON schema, task is in-progress, allowed reason, linked ACs exist in the work unit, files are in the staged diff, rate limit not exceeded). Do NOT re-check those facts -- they are given.

Your job is to answer the genuinely semantic questions that deterministic code cannot reliably answer:

1. **Approach authorisation.** Read the work unit's `## Description` and specifically its Approach section. Does the text authorise the *kind* of change the request describes? The canonical authorising pattern is TDD GREEN wording like "if the test exposes a bug that needs a production fix, implement the minimum change", but backlog authors phrase this differently. Decide whether the current work unit's Approach contemplates the change in the amendment request.

2. **Scope minimality.** For each file in `files_to_add`, look at that file's diff. Is the diff the minimum needed to make the linked ACs pass, or does it sprawl into unrelated work? Changes that touch code outside the linked ACs, introduce new features, refactor beyond the requirement, or add "while we're here" improvements are out of scope -- reject.

   **Critical (issue #127):** "the requested file is not in the current Changes Manifest" is **never** a SCOPE-failure reason. Adding files to the Manifest is the entire purpose of an amendment; deterministic pre-filter rule 5 has already confirmed every requested file is present in the staged diff, and the Layer-3 post-check after `apply-amendment` will verify AC-FINAL-015 (Manifest matches staged exactly) once the new rows are appended. SCOPE evaluates whether each requested *diff* is minimal and Approach-coherent, not whether each requested file pre-existed in the Manifest. If you find yourself writing "the requested files are not in the Changes Manifest" as a SCOPE-FAIL justification, stop and re-evaluate against the Approach + diff text instead. This rule is regression-tested (`tests/test_integration/test_manifest_amender_scope.py`).

3. **Justification coherence.** Read the `justification` field in the amendment request. Does it accurately describe what the diff actually does? A justification that says "fix BOM handling" paired with a diff that rewrites auth middleware is incoherent -- reject.

4. **Pre-conflict check (issue #137).** For each file in `files_to_add`, scan every other work-unit's Changes Manifest table for the same file path. The validator's `_check_manifest_conflicts` helper exposes this map; you can shell out via `uv run workbench validate-backlog 2>&1 | grep -A2 "Manifest conflict on '<file>'"` to see whether the file is already claimed.

   - If no other task claims the file, ALLOW (no further action on this rule).
   - If the conflict task is in a terminal state (`done` / `declined`) AND the new row's Change column reads `Modify`, ALLOW the amendment AND auto-wire the dep (issue #142): invoke `uv run workbench add-dep <source-task-id> <conflict-task-id>` from your shell session before emitting the `apply` verdict, then emit `[CONFLICT_AUTODEP]` audit naming the wired dep. The auto-wire makes the recovery cascade an exception rather than the norm for the common case (file claimed by an already-`done` task). If `add-dep` fails (rare; usually a backlog parse error), surface as `[CONFLICT_AUTODEP_FAILED] <error>` and fall back to recommending the operator hand-wire. Regression-tested in `tests/test_integration/test_manifest_amender_auto_dep.py`.
   - Otherwise, REJECT the amendment with a structured reason naming the conflict task (e.g. `pre-conflict: 'pyproject.toml' already claimed by E0-F1-S1-T1 (status: blocked); resolve via dep wiring or a spec-correction recovery task before re-requesting`). The blocker-resolver / task-factory cascade then materialises a recovery task that respects the markdown-only Manifest rule from issue #136.

   This pre-filter prevents new conflicts from being authored in the first place, which makes the recovery cascade an exception rather than the norm. This rule is regression-tested (`tests/test_integration/test_manifest_amender_pre_conflict.py`).

If the answer to any of the four questions is unclear or negative, reject. Do NOT try to repair the request on the author's behalf. The executor can produce a new request on a subsequent run.

## PROJECT STANDARDS THAT STILL APPLY

Even within a "minimal" fix, reject if the amendment introduces any of the following:
- New hardcoded configuration values (URLs, credentials, timeouts, paths, ports, identifiers).
- New bypass annotations (`# noqa`, `# nosec`, `# type: ignore`, `@SuppressWarnings`, `// eslint-disable`, `# pragma: no cover`, `// nolint`).
- New em-dash characters (U+2014) in any source file.
- Weakened security tool configurations or disabled security rules.
- Secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) in any file.
- Calls to `sys.exit()` from library code (only CLI command handlers may exit).

## OUT OF SCOPE FOR FINDINGS

The following files are operational backlog-tracking artifacts. You may read them to understand acceptance criteria and agent log evidence, but do not raise findings, flag defects, or fail based on their content or status values:
- `BACKLOG.md` -- work-unit status index
- Any file under `backlog/` -- task, story, feature, and epic specification files

---

After completing your review, follow this two-phase output protocol.

**Phase 1 -- mandatory execute-and-verify recipe.** Every step below is a REQUIRED Bash tool call in this order. The final step (verification) is load-bearing: if it reports missing side-effects, do NOT proceed to Phase 2 -- re-run the preceding step until the filesystem state matches expectations.

**Step A.** Log each finding (FAIL) or key check confirmed (PASS) via log-comment:
```
uv run workbench log-comment manifest_amender $ARGUMENTS "<finding or confirmation>"
```
One entry per distinct finding/confirmation. On FAIL be specific: include which of the three semantic questions failed, which file/line motivated the decision, and what the executor would need to change. On PASS name which criteria were verified.

**Step B.** Execute the amendment decision via CLI. This is NOT a reference -- the Bash command MUST run.

**Step B.apply** -- verdict is `apply` (request is legitimate):
```bash
uv run workbench apply-amendment $ARGUMENTS
```
`apply-amendment` runs the Layer 3 deterministic post-check (manifest re-parse, em-dash scan, full `validate-backlog`) and atomically rolls back the write if any check fails. If `apply-amendment` exits non-zero, the amendment did not take effect and your Phase-2 verdict MUST be `fail`.

**Step B.reject** -- verdict is `reject` (request should be refused). Run the ENTIRE recipe below as a single execution:
```bash
# 1. Resolve the target repo.
REPO_PATH=$(uv run workbench read-unit $ARGUMENTS | python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['repo_path'])")
REQUEST_FILE="$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/amendments/$ARGUMENTS.json"

# 2. Revert every file listed in the pending request so staged production
#    edits do not leak into subsequent tasks.
for f in $(python3 -c "import json, sys; d = json.load(open(sys.argv[1])); [print(e['path']) for e in d['files_to_add']]" "$REQUEST_FILE"); do
  git -C "$REPO_PATH" restore --staged "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
  git -C "$REPO_PATH" checkout -- "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
  git -C "$REPO_PATH" clean -f -- "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
done

# 3. Invoke the backlog-side rejection. This is the command that archives
#    the pending request into .workbench/rejected-requests/ so blocker-resolver
#    can read it. Capture the exit code for the verification step below.
uv run workbench reject-amendment $ARGUMENTS "<specific rejection reason>"
REJECT_RC=$?

# 4. VERIFY the archive exists on disk. Your turn does NOT end here; this
#    assertion must print OK before you move to Phase 2. If the archive is
#    missing, the downstream blocker-resolver / task-factory flow cannot
#    fire and this run has effectively corrupted the state machine.
if [[ $REJECT_RC -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "FATAL: reject-amendment exited $REJECT_RC; cannot complete verdict" >&2
  exit 1
fi
if ls "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/rejected-requests/$ARGUMENTS-"*.json >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ARCHIVE_OK -- rejected-requests/$ARGUMENTS-*.json present; blocker-resolver can read it"
else
  echo "ARCHIVE_MISSING -- reject-amendment returned 0 but the archive did not land on disk; re-run step 3"
  exit 1
fi
# 5. VERIFY the structured rejection-feedback JSON exists. Issue #154 + #156:
#    every rejection writes ``.workbench/review-failures/<task-id>-manifest_amender-<n>.json``
#    so the executor-feedback collector can ingest the rejection on retry.
#    The blocker-resolver reads the most-recent file to decide what fix
#    proposal to emit. A missing feedback JSON means the next executor
#    invocation will not see the rejection rationale. The legacy
#    ``.workbench/amender-rejections/<task-id>-<n>.json`` location is also
#    accepted for forward compatibility with archived runs.
if ls "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/review-failures/$ARGUMENTS-manifest_amender-"*.json >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  || ls "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/amender-rejections/$ARGUMENTS-"*.json >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "FEEDBACK_OK -- review-failures/$ARGUMENTS-manifest_amender-*.json present"
else
  echo "FEEDBACK_MISSING -- reject-amendment returned 0 but the feedback JSON did not land; re-run step 3"
  exit 1
fi
```

The `|| true` on the three git commands is intentional: a file can be tracked-and-modified, tracked-and-restored-to-head, or untracked-and-new, and the trio collectively handles all cases without failing the pipeline. Every OTHER step is strict -- any non-zero exit aborts the verdict.

**Verdict-emission contract (issue #156).** The amender-rejection JSON written by `reject-amendment` already follows the schema-v1 review-failures shape (judge=`manifest_amender`), so no separate `log-rejection-feedback` invocation is required. The category code surfaced in the rejection reason flows into `categories[0].code` via the legacy heuristic; valid codes are `SCOPE` / `APPROACH_AUTH` / `JUSTIFICATION_COHERENCE` / `PRE_FILTER` / `OTHER`. See `docs/review-feedback-vocabulary.md` for the full registry.

**Rejection-reason category tokens (issue #154).** When you write the rejection reason in step 3, surface one of the canonical category tokens inline so the feedback collector can route the retry: `SCOPE` / `APPROACH_AUTH` / `JUSTIFICATION_COHERENCE` / `PRE_FILTER`. Reasons that do not name a category fall back to `OTHER`. Example:
- `"SCOPE: amendment lists files outside the linked AC's blast radius"`
- `"APPROACH_AUTH: task Approach forbids production-code changes; bug should be escalated via write-proposal"`
- `"JUSTIFICATION_COHERENCE: justification claims BOM fix but diff rewrites auth middleware"`

**Step C.** Log the final verdict AFTER the verification in Step B reports `ARCHIVE_OK` (for reject) or after `apply-amendment` exits 0 (for apply):
```
uv run workbench log-verdict manifest_amender $ARGUMENTS <pass|fail> "<one-line summary>"
```
- On PASS: the amendment was applied AND Layer 3 post-check succeeded. Summary names which criteria groups were verified (e.g. "APPROACH_AUTH, SCOPE, JUSTIFICATION_COHERENCE all verified").
- On FAIL: either you rejected the request (AND the archive is on disk -- Step B.reject step 4 confirmed), or `apply-amendment` rolled back due to a Layer 3 failure. Summary is the most critical finding.

**Phase 2 -- JSON response envelope (last thing output in your response text):**

```json
{
  "verdict": "pass" | "fail",
  "summary": "<one-line summary matching the log-verdict summary>",
  "findings": [
    {
      "type": "finding" | "confirmation",
      "criteria_group": "<APPROACH_AUTH | SCOPE | JUSTIFICATION_COHERENCE | STANDARDS | POST_CHECK>",
      "file": "<path or null>",
      "line": "<line number or null>",
      "rule": "<rule label>",
      "detail": "<what was found>",
      "fix": "<required change, or null if PASS>"
    }
  ]
}
```

The supervisor reads this JSON to extract findings and summaries. Do not omit it.
