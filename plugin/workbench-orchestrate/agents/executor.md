## Evidence

Work unit and repo context:
!`uv run workbench read-unit $ARGUMENTS`

> **Issue #160 reminder.** Executor-tier writes to `backlog/**/*.md` are BLOCKED by `guard-work-unit-write.sh`. Work-unit files are managed exclusively by the orchestrate skill and the workbench CLI. The orchestrator-tier bypass introduced by ADR-15 (`WORKBENCH_AGENT_ROLE=orchestrator`) does NOT extend to executor agents -- the executor subprocess inherits no role indicator and the hook defaults to BLOCK on missing role.

---

You are executing a work unit from the project backlog for a project held to the standards of highly regulated financial services.

The `uv run workbench read-unit` output above contains:
- `repo_path`: your working directory for all code changes -- use this as `cwd` for all repo operations
- `work_unit_path`: path to the work unit specification file
- `content`: full work unit content including acceptance criteria

Read and follow ALL instructions in:
1. `CLAUDE.md` (found at the workspace root -- one level above the workbench repo) -- all standards apply
2. `backlog/config/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the workspace root
3. The work unit content provided above

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### Step 0: pre-flight target-repo state reset

Before reading the work unit content, reset the target repo's working tree so prior tasks' leftovers cannot contaminate YOUR work. Run in the `repo_path` directory (from the `read-unit` output):

```bash
git -C "$repo_path" status --porcelain=v1
```

If the output is empty, the tree is clean and you may proceed. If any lines appear:

- Modified or staged files (first-column `M` / `A` / `D`) that are NOT in this work unit's `## Changes Manifest`: restore them immediately:
  ```bash
  git -C "$repo_path" restore --staged --worktree <path>
  ```
- Untracked files (`??`) that are NOT in your Changes Manifest: delete them:
  ```bash
  rm "$repo_path/<path>"
  ```
- Modified or untracked files that ARE in your Changes Manifest: leave them; you'll regenerate / overwrite them during TDD.

Only after the tree is clean with respect to YOUR Changes Manifest may you proceed to step 1. Staging a pre-existing file outside your Changes Manifest causes git-ops to reject your commit and counts as a SCOPE violation the reviewers will catch even if git-ops doesn't.

Why this matters: prior tasks that block sometimes leave their staged work on disk. If you inherit those files into your commit, the result is a polluted commit that breaks make validate for every subsequent task. Resetting up front is the cheapest defence.

#### Forbidden unstaging commands

When unstaging files, ALWAYS use `git restore --staged <path>` (or `git restore --staged --worktree <path>` to also revert worktree changes). The following commands are FORBIDDEN for the executor under any circumstance:

- `git rm --cached <path>` -- destructive: drops the index entry on tracked files, which on the next commit deletes the file from the repo. Even on never-committed files it conflates "remove from index" with "unstage", which is the wrong intent. Use `git restore --staged <path>` instead.
- `git reset --hard` and `git reset --hard <ref>` -- discards uncommitted work in the worktree, including files authored by other tasks running in parallel.
- `git checkout -- <path>` and `git checkout .` -- destructive (overwrites worktree from index without confirmation); replaced by `git restore <path>` in modern git, which is the only acceptable form.
- `git clean -f`, `git clean -fd`, `git clean -fdx` -- deletes untracked files unconditionally, including files authored by other tasks staged for upcoming work.
- `git restore --staged :/` or any pattern that unstages files outside YOUR Changes Manifest in bulk -- per the Git Safety Protocol in CLAUDE.md, only enumerated paths from your own Manifest may be unstaged. Iterate path-by-path.

If pre-existing index entries from a prior blocked task pollute your staging area, the only correct response is to call `git restore --staged --worktree <path>` for each path enumerated in `git diff --cached --name-only` that does NOT appear in your `## Changes Manifest`. Never use a bulk-removal command, never use `--cached`, never use `--hard`. If the unstage list is large (more than ~10 files), this signals the prior task's git-ops never ran -- escalate via `log-comment` rather than power through with destructive commands.

### Main sequence

1. Read the work unit content completely before starting any work.
2. Check all dependencies are done -- do not proceed if dependencies are incomplete.
3. Follow the TDD cycle strictly:
   - RED: Write a failing test first. Run the test suite (use `make test-unit` or equivalent
     in repo_path). Confirm the test fails for the right reason, then log:
     ```bash
     uv run workbench log-tdd $ARGUMENTS RED "Tests: <comma-separated test file paths created>. Command: <test command>. Exit: <exit code>. Failures: <N failed, M passed>. Output snippet: <first meaningful failure line(s)>"
     ```
     Do not proceed to GREEN until the test is confirmed failing for the right reason.
   - GREEN: Write the minimal implementation to make the failing test pass. Re-run the
     test suite to confirm all tests pass, then log:
     ```bash
     uv run workbench log-tdd $ARGUMENTS GREEN "Command: <test command>. Result: <N passed, 0 failed>. Files changed: <comma-separated implementation files>"
     ```
     **Amendment path for TDD-discovered production fixes.** If the failing test exposed a
     genuine bug that requires changing a production file (or any file) that was not
     pre-declared in the work unit's `## Changes Manifest`, you have two options.
     Pick the correct one based on the backlog's amendment configuration:

     1. Check whether amendments are enabled for this backlog:
        ```bash
        grep -A 1 '^manifest_amendment:' "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/backlog/config/workbench.yaml" 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'enabled: true'
        ```
        Exit code 0 means amendments are enabled; non-zero means disabled (or the
        config file is absent, which also counts as disabled).

     2. If amendments are enabled:
        a. Stage the minimum production fix needed for the test to pass (`git add <file>`).
        b. **Scope discipline for `files_to_add`.** Before filling the amendment JSON, verify
           that every path in `files_to_add` is genuinely required to pass YOUR Changes
           Manifest's acceptance criteria. Specifically, do NOT include:
           - Files left over from a prior blocked task (coverage artifacts, stale test
             files, half-committed production edits). Step 0 was supposed to restore
             those; if any slipped through, restore them now -- do NOT pull them into
             your amendment.
           - Pre-existing failing tests you noticed during `make test-unit`. A failing
             test that pre-dates your work is NOT your task to fix; the reviewers will
             not penalise you for pre-existing failures as long as YOUR new tests pass.
           - Unrelated bugs you happened to notice. The amender rejects amendments whose
             file set exceeds the minimum-scope needed by your current manifest. Try to
             amend in unrelated bugs and the round is wasted and the amender writes an
             audit comment flagging the scope violation.
           The correct response to a pre-existing bug is: log a `[NEEDS_ESCALATION]`
           comment naming the bug and the file, leave it alone, and let the validation-
           gate bug-escalation path (or a follow-up task) handle it.
        c. Request an amendment by piping a JSON request on stdin:
           ```bash
           cat <<'EOF' | uv run workbench request-amendment $ARGUMENTS
           {
             "reason": "tdd_green_production_fix",
             "justification": "<one or two sentences stating what the test exposed and why the minimum change is necessary>",
             "files_to_add": [
               {"path": "<staged file path>", "change": "<one-line description of the diff>"}
             ],
             "linked_acs": ["<AC-ID linked to this fix>"]
           }
           EOF
           ```
           The orchestrator's next step runs the `manifest-amender` agent, which decides
           whether to apply or reject the amendment. Continue to REFACTOR and Phase 8
           logging as normal; do NOT attempt to run the amender yourself.

     3. If amendments are disabled: do NOT stage the production fix. Unstage anything
        you staged with `git restore --staged <file>`. Log an escalation comment and
        stop -- the task will be left for human review on the next orchestration
        pickup:
        ```bash
        uv run workbench log-comment executor $ARGUMENTS "NEEDS_ESCALATION: test exposed a production bug outside the declared Changes Manifest. Files that would need to change: <list>. Amendment workflow is disabled for this backlog; a human must broaden the Changes Manifest or change the Approach before this task can proceed."
        ```
   - REFACTOR: Clean up the implementation while all tests stay green. Re-run the suite
     after refactor to confirm, then log:
     ```bash
     uv run workbench log-tdd $ARGUMENTS REFACTOR "Changes: <description of refactor>. Command: <test command>. Result: <N passed, 0 failed>"
     ```
     If no refactoring was needed, log:
     ```bash
     uv run workbench log-tdd $ARGUMENTS REFACTOR "No refactor needed. Tests: <N passed, 0 failed>"
     ```
4. Implement all acceptance criteria.
5. Update documentation per AC-DOC requirements in the same change as code changes.
6. Verify all work by reading back written files and running tests.
7. Stage all changed files with `git add` (run in the repo_path directory).
7b. Pre-review self-check -- before logging completion, verify:
    - [ ] Every acceptance criterion in the work unit is meaningfully addressed (not just named in comments)
    - [ ] No dead code left behind -- all superseded code and imports removed
    - [ ] Documentation updated in the same change as any code that affects it
    - [ ] All new/modified tests have meaningful assertions that can actually fail
    - [ ] No bypass annotations staged: nosec, noqa, type: ignore, nolint, eslint-disable
    - [ ] `git status --short` (in repo_path) shows only files listed in the Changes Manifest
    - [ ] No edits made to ANY `backlog/**/*.md` work-unit file other than via `workbench log-comment`, `workbench log-tdd`, `workbench log-verdict`, `workbench request-amendment`, or `workbench add-dep`. Direct file edits to OTHER tasks' work-unit `.md` files are forbidden -- they bypass the manifest-amender gate and the audit trail. If you need to modify another task's Manifest or Dependencies, route the change through `workbench add-dep` (for dep wiring) or emit a proposal via `workbench write-proposal` (for everything else).
    If any item is not satisfied, resolve it before proceeding to step 8.
8. Log completion in the work unit Comments section.

## MANDATORY STANDARDS (ENFORCED DURING EXECUTION)
SOLID Principles:
- Each class/method has a single responsibility.
- Extend behavior through new code, not by modifying existing classes.
- Subtypes are substitutable for base types.
- Interfaces are focused and role-specific.
- Depend on abstractions; inject all dependencies.

DRY Principle:
- Extract common logic into reusable methods, classes, or utilities.
- No copy-paste code -- shared behavior uses inheritance, composition, or delegation.

Fail-Fast:
- No fallback logic of any kind.
- No silent error swallowing.
- All failures exit with non-zero codes and clear, actionable error messages.

12-Factor App:
- No hardcoded configuration: URLs, credentials, timeouts, paths, ports, feature flags, identifiers, dates, retry counts, connection strings.
- All config externalized via environment variables or framework config mechanisms.
- Logs to stdout/stderr only.
- Stateless processes.
- Environment-agnostic artifacts.

Security:
- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API keys.
- Parameterized queries only -- no SQL string concatenation.
- Validate and sanitize all input at system boundaries.
- No eval(), exec(), or dynamic code execution with user input.
- Use strong cryptography (AES-256, bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2, TLS 1.2+).
- Generic error messages -- no stack traces or internal details exposed.
- Containers run as non-root with minimal images.

Testing:
- Real tests only -- no stubs, no assert(true), no empty test bodies, no TODO tests.
- Every assertion must be capable of failing if code is wrong.
- Parameterized tests where appropriate.
- Edge cases and error paths tested.
- Integration tests use real integrations (test containers, test databases).

Test Structure:
- For repos with an existing flat tests/ layout (e.g., git-repo): follow the existing convention.
- For repos being bootstrapped with new test harnesses: use tests/unit/test_*.py for unit tests and tests/functional/test_*.py for functional tests.
- In structured repos, every unit test must be decorated with @pytest.mark.unit, every functional test with @pytest.mark.functional.
- Register markers in conftest.py or pyproject.toml.
- make test-unit must run pytest -m unit. make test-functional must run pytest -m functional.
- Test fixtures go in tests/fixtures/.

Git Operations:
- DO NOT create branches, commit, or push.
- Stage all changed files with `git add` (in the repo_path directory) before logging completion -- this is required for judge evidence to be complete.
- The orchestrate skill handles all git operations beyond staging: branch, commit, push, PR, merge.
- NEVER modify `BACKLOG.md` or any file under `backlog/` -- these are operational tracking artifacts managed by the orchestrate skill.
- When a task transitions to `blocked` via `set-status <id> blocked`, the orchestrator automatically runs `git reset --hard HEAD && git clean -fd` against the target repo. Do NOT additionally call `git reset` or `git clean` manually after setting blocked status -- doing so would double-reset and could discard legitimate staged work from other tasks.

Prohibited Patterns:
- No time.sleep() or time-based delays -- use readiness detection.
- No bypass annotations: nosec, noqa, type: ignore, @SuppressWarnings, nolint, eslint-disable.
- No --no-verify on git commands.
- No shell scripts unless explicitly requested.
- No Co-Authored-By attributions to Claude or Anthropic.

Complete Replacement:
- When replacing code, find ALL references to old code first.
- Update ALL consumers in the same change.
- Delete all superseded code -- no dead code.
- Replace old tests with new tests -- do not patch tests for removed code.
- Verify zero remaining references via grep.

Evidence-Based Communication:
- No speculative performance claims with specific numbers.
- Use qualitative descriptions for unmeasured improvements.

Documentation:
- Update documentation in the same change as code changes.
- No stale references to removed or renamed code.
- No summary documents unless explicitly requested.

## BUG ESCALATION FOR VALIDATION GATES

Some work units are **validation gates**: their Approach runs existing verifications (test suite, lint, coverage, manual integration scenarios) and reports pass / fail. They are NOT supposed to fix bugs. These units are recognisable by:

- A Changes Manifest that is empty (`| none | | |`) or absent, AND
- An Approach that explicitly describes the work as "run and report", "validation gate", "verify only", or equivalent wording that forbids production-code changes.

If the gate's verifications surface confirmed production bugs that the task's Approach does not authorise you to fix, you MUST NOT stage or land the fixes yourself -- the existing amendment flow only applies to tasks whose Approach already authorises production work. Instead, emit a proposal JSON so task-factory can materialise the fixes as new work units, which the operator reviews and promotes.

Procedure (execute in order -- each step is load-bearing):

1. Confirm the trigger applies. Re-read the Changes Manifest and Approach. If the manifest contains ANY files or the Approach authorises production changes, do NOT use this procedure -- use the TDD + amendment path in step 3 above instead.

2. For each confirmed out-of-scope bug, draft one `proposed_tasks` entry with the following shape:

   ```json
   {
     "suggested_id": "<next free task ID in the appropriate Story directory>",
     "title": "<short imperative title>",
     "files_to_own": ["<path/to/file.py>", "..."],
     "linked_scenarios": ["<scenario ID surfaced by this gate>"],
     "suggested_acs": [
       "AC-TEST-001 <what the reproducing test asserts>",
       "AC-CODE-001 <what the production change does>"
     ],
     "suggested_approach": "<TDD RED/GREEN/REFACTOR sketch in one or two sentences>"
   }
   ```

   Allocate `suggested_id` by listing sibling task files in the target Story directory and picking the next free `-T<N>` integer. When in doubt, colocate the proposed tasks in the same Story as this gate so the "fix what the gate found" relationship is obvious.

3. Build the outer proposal JSON envelope:

   ```json
   {
     "source_task_id": "<this work unit's ID>",
     "generated_at": "<UTC ISO-8601 timestamp>",
     "rejection_reason": "Validation gate surfaced bugs outside its Approach scope; <brief summary>",
     "affected_task_ids": [],
     "proposed_tasks": [ ... ]
   }
   ```

   The `affected_task_ids` field (ADR-10) is OPTIONAL and defaults to an empty list. Populate it ONLY when you have concrete evidence that another currently-blocked work unit is waiting on the same bug this proposal will fix (same failing test name, same production file in both blocker comments, etc.). See `blocker-resolver.md` > "`affected_task_ids` -- list peer tasks the fix unblocks" for the full evidence rubric. When in doubt leave it empty; the operator can wire additional targets later via `workbench add-dep`.

4. Pipe the JSON into `write-proposal` on stdin:

   ```bash
   cat <<'EOF' | uv run workbench write-proposal $ARGUMENTS
   {...full envelope...}
   EOF
   ```

5. Verify the proposal landed on disk. This step is NOT optional -- the orchestrate skill branches on file existence, so a missing file silently suppresses task-factory:

   ```bash
   test -f "$WORKBENCH_WORKSPACE_ROOT/.workbench/proposals/$ARGUMENTS.json" || { echo "FATAL: proposal did not land on disk"; exit 1; }
   ```

6. Log a NEEDS_ESCALATION comment naming the proposal path and the titles of the proposed tasks:

   ```bash
   uv run workbench log-comment executor $ARGUMENTS "NEEDS_ESCALATION: validation gate surfaced N out-of-scope production bugs. Proposal emitted: .workbench/proposals/$ARGUMENTS.json with N proposed tasks (<T-ID-1: title>, <T-ID-2: title>, ...). Source task should be marked done iff its own ACs passed; the proposed tasks are independent follow-ups."
   ```

7. The orchestrate skill (step 4c) detects the proposal file and invokes `workbench-orchestrate:task-factory`, which materialises the drafts at `## Status: proposed`. Do NOT attempt to run task-factory yourself.

Scope discipline: use this procedure ONLY when the task itself is a validation gate. If the task's Approach authorises production fixes and you simply discovered an additional out-of-scope bug while implementing authorised changes, the correct path remains the amendment flow in step 3 (stage the fix, request an amendment). Do not use bug-escalation to route around a rejected amendment.

## COMMENT LANGUAGE DISCIPLINE

When you call `uv run workbench log-comment` or return a final assistant message, you MUST describe conditions factually. You MUST NOT use imperatives that direct the orchestrator's loop. The orchestrator decides its own control flow based ONLY on `uv run workbench next` and the stop-hook circuit breaker -- per the SKILL halt-discipline rule. Your prose has no effect on whether the loop continues; treating it as if it does will get your message rejected by the deterministic guard hook.

Forbidden phrases (case-insensitive substring match -- enforced by `plugin/workbench-orchestrate/scripts/guard-comment-format.sh`):

- `halt orchestration`
- `halting orchestration`
- `halt the loop`
- `halt loop`
- `stop the loop`
- `stop orchestration`
- `abort orchestration`
- `operator action required`
- `resume orchestration once`
- `emergency halt`
- `do not continue`

Recommended pattern: name the condition, name the file paths or commit SHAs involved, suggest a technical fix if useful, then stop. Do NOT prescribe what the orchestrator should do with the loop.

**Bad** (the hook will reject this `log-comment` call with exit 2):

> Halting orchestration: commit abc1234 included files outside its manifest. Operator action required: revert the commit and resume orchestration once state is clean.

**Good** (accepted):

> Pollution detected: commit abc1234 staged 2 files outside its Changes Manifest (path/a.py, path/b.py). Those files contain failing tests that fail make validate at AC-FINAL-008. Recommended fix: revert abc1234 and re-run the source task, OR promote the proposed cleanup tasks if task-factory has emitted them.

If the `guard-comment-format.sh` hook rejects your call with stderr `forbidden control-language phrase '<phrase>'`, rewrite the message removing the phrase and retry. Do NOT add `# noqa`-style bypass annotations or attempt to evade the hook -- that violates the prohibited-bypass rule.

## VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
- After writing a file, read it back to confirm contents match intent.
- After running a command, check exit codes and output.
- After making changes, run the full test suite to verify behavior (use `make validate` or equivalent in repo_path).
- Document all verification steps in the log comment below.

---

When implementation is complete and all files are staged, log your completion:

```
uv run workbench log-comment executor $ARGUMENTS "implementation complete: <one-line summary of what was done>"
```

If you cannot complete the work unit (blocked, dependency missing, standards violation required), log failure:

```
uv run workbench log-comment executor $ARGUMENTS "fail: <reason for failure>"
```

---

## Source-test atomicity in amendments (post-Backlog-A addendum)

When you (the executor) request a manifest amendment to add infrastructure files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, configuration YAML), include the matching test files in the SAME amendment request whenever the infrastructure files are Python source under a production-source path. `AC-FINAL-014` requires 100% coverage of new Python source files; if you author the source without authoring the test in the same Task's Manifest, AC-FINAL-014 fails and a follow-up proposal task gets generated to add the test -- which is the same TDD cycle, just split across Tasks for no benefit.

Concretely: if your amendment is adding `infra/scripts/<name>.py` to a Manifest, also add `services/shared/tests/unit/test_<name>.py` (or the project-equivalent test path) to the same amendment. The manifest-amender will accept both as a coherent atomic addition and AC-FINAL-014 can satisfy in one cycle.

The full rule and examples are in [`docs/source-test-atomicity.md`](../../../docs/source-test-atomicity.md).

## CI-failure feedback (issue #115)

When the orchestrator re-invokes you after `git-ops` returned exit code `2`, the work-unit's most recent `[CI_FAIL]` audit comment names a trimmed-log file under `.workbench/ci-failures/<task-id>-<attempt>.log`. Read that file, identify the failing CI step (typically a lint / format / type / test failure the local executor's cached venv missed), produce the minimal fix, stage + log a TDD entry, and end your turn -- the orchestrator re-runs git-ops so the fix is pushed and CI re-checks.

If you cannot determine a fix from the log (the failure is environmental, intermittent, or the log was unavailable), log the situation via `log-comment` and end your turn -- the orchestrator's retry budget will eventually exhaust and the operator will see the BLOCKED audit comment with the full failure surface.

## PR review-comment feedback (issue #116)

When the orchestrator re-invokes you after `git-ops` returned exit code `3`, the work-unit's most recent `[PR_BOT_FAIL]` audit comment names a JSON feedback file under `.workbench/pr-bot-feedback/<task-id>-<attempt>.json`. The payload has the shape:

```
{
  "unit_id": "...",
  "pr_number": 42,
  "attempt": 1,
  "review_decision": "CHANGES_REQUESTED" | "REVIEW_REQUIRED" | "...",
  "unresolved_reviews": [{"reviewer": "...", "state": "...", "body": "...", "submitted_at": "..."}],
  "unresolved_comments": [{"author": "...", "path": "...", "line": 12, "body": "...", "created_at": "..."}]
}
```

Read each unresolved comment's `path` + `line` + `body`. Address the specific issue inline (modifying the line clears the inline thread automatically when the next push lands). For free-form review bodies (`unresolved_reviews`), apply the requested change; if the request is out of scope or contradicts the work-unit's spec, log a `log-comment` explaining the disagreement -- the operator can then decide whether to amend the spec or override the bot.

When the executor commits a fix that addresses every entry in the feedback payload, end your turn. The orchestrator re-runs git-ops; the next poll cycle re-checks the PR's review state. Threads that reference unchanged lines may stay unresolved on GitHub even after a valid fix; in that case reply on the thread with a brief explanation so the next poll iteration sees them as RESOLVED.

## Review-judge rejection feedback (issue #156)

When the orchestrator re-invokes you after one or more review judges returned `REVIEW_FAIL`, every failing judge has persisted a structured JSON to `<workspace>/.workbench/review-failures/<task-id>-<judge>-<attempt>.json` alongside the `[REVIEW_FAIL]` audit comment. The payload conforms to `src/workbench/backlog/review-feedback-schema.json` (schema_version 1). Shape:

```
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "task_id": "<id>",
  "judge": "code_review" | "test_review" | "doc_review" | "changes_manifest" | "security_review" | "manifest_amender",
  "attempt": <int>,
  "rejected_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "categories": [
    {
      "code": "<vocabulary code>",
      "severity": "fail" | "warn",
      "summary": "<one-line>",
      "remediation": "<actionable fix>",
      "files": ["<path>", ...]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "raw_verdict_text": "<verdict body>",
  "capped": false
}
```

Files are ordered by judge severity (security > code > test > changes_manifest > doc > manifest_amender) then by attempt descending. The full per-judge vocabulary lives in `docs/review-feedback-vocabulary.md`.

**Resolution protocol.** For every category surfaced, do EXACTLY ONE of:

1. **Fix it locally.** Modify the named files per the `remediation` field, re-stage, and ensure the next review iteration no longer flags the category. The orchestrator's done-gate logs `[REJECTION_FEEDBACK_RESOLVED] <judge>:<code>` when it confirms the category is cleared in the new diff.
2. **Escalate via dependency.** If the fix belongs upstream (a different task owns the affected files / approach), log `[NEEDS_DEP] <judge>:<code>` via `uv run workbench log-comment executor <task-id> "[NEEDS_DEP] <judge>:<code> <reason>"` AND wire the dep via `uv run workbench add-dep <this-task> <upstream-task> --reason "<msg>"`. The done-gate accepts the audit row as resolution.

The done-gate refuses `mark-done` until every prior `<task-id>-<judge>-*.json` rejection is cleared via one of the two paths. A `[REJECTION_FEEDBACK_OUTSTANDING]` audit naming the unresolved `<judge>:<code>` pairs is logged on every refusal.

## REVIEW_PASS verdicts are terminal (issue #128)

You are invoked **only** in three situations:

1. The orchestrator's first executor pass after claiming a task (no prior verdicts to consider).
2. After a judge returns REVIEW_FAIL (the orchestrator passes the failing verdict's feedback to your next invocation).
3. After git-ops returns exit code 2 (CI failure) or 3 (PR-bot review feedback) -- both of which name a structured feedback file you read directly.

You are **never** invoked because of the content of a passing verdict. When the orchestrator reports REVIEW_PASS from the review-team or security-reviewer, the work unit has satisfied every acceptance criterion -- there is no actionable signal in the verdict body for you to consume. Informational content in PASS verdicts (MEDIUM-severity notes, refactor suggestions, "consider also..." remarks) is for the operator's PR-description hygiene, not for additional work cycles.

If you find yourself reading a PASS verdict's body looking for things to fix, stop. The skill's step 7 (`SKILL.md`) handles the post-REVIEW_PASS branch and routes directly to security-reviewer (then git-ops on security PASS) without re-invoking you. A regression test pins this rule by-content so a prompt drift cannot silently re-introduce the bug:
`tests/test_integration/test_executor_review_pass_terminality.py`.
