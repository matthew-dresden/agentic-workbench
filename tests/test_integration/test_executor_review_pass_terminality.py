"""Issue #128 regression: executor must not act on REVIEW_PASS verdict bodies.

The orchestrate skill (`plugin/workbench-orchestrate/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md`) and the
executor agent prompt (`plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/executor.md`) are runtime
prompts the LLM reads via Claude Agent SDK; there is no Python entry point to
call-and-assert against. This test pins the canonical "REVIEW_PASS is
terminal" language by-content so a future edit cannot silently remove the
rule that prevents the bug from returning.

Bug: at runtime the executor read a MEDIUM-severity informational note inside
a security_review PASS verdict, treated it as a required action item, and
performed a REFACTOR cycle (10 new tests + COGNITO_CONFIG guards) instead of
proceeding to git-ops. git-ops then failed because PR creation was redundant
on the same branch (companion issue #129). Issue #128.

Fix: SKILL.md step 7 now contains an explicit "CRITICAL (issue #128)" rule
that REVIEW_PASS is terminal -- the orchestrator branches solely on
pass-vs-fail, never on verdict-body content. executor.md gains a parallel
"REVIEW_PASS verdicts are terminal" section that lists the three (and only
three) situations where the executor is legitimately invoked, and forbids
acting on PASS verdict content.

This test asserts each protective fragment is present so an accidental edit
that removes one of them fails CI before merging.
