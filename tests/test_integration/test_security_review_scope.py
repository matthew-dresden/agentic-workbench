"""Issue #126 regression: security-reviewer prompt must scope findings to staged diff.

The security reviewer is a runtime prompt the LLM reads via Claude Agent
SDK; there is no Python entry point to call-and-assert against. This
test pins the prompt's canonical scope-contract language by-content so a
future edit cannot silently remove the rule that prevents the bug from
returning.

Bug: at runtime the security reviewer evaluated working-tree files
outside the active task's staged diff, picked up findings on a file
owned by a different work unit (E1-F2-S4-T1's
``infra/remote-state/prod/terragrunt.hcl``), and BLOCKed the in-flight
work unit on a problem that didn't belong to it. Issue #126.

Fix: ``plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/security-reviewer.md`` now contains an
explicit five-bullet "Scope contract (issue #126 -- enforced)" block
that:
  1. Mandates capturing the in-scope path set from ``workbench get-diff``
     before reading any file.
  2. Forbids reading files outside the in-scope set.
  3. Forbids raw ``git diff origin/main`` style scope computations.
  4. Requires every finding's verdict body to cite an in-scope path
     (out-of-scope findings are silently dropped).
  5. Returns PASS with a fixed summary when the in-scope set is empty.

This test asserts each of the five rule-fragments is present so an
accidental edit that removes one of them fails CI before merging.
