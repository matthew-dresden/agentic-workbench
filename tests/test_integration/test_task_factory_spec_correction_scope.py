"""Issue #136 regression: task-factory spec-correction recovery tasks must
list ONLY the work-unit markdown file in their Changes Manifest.

Background: when the auto-recovery cascade (blocker-resolver -> task-factory)
materialises a recovery task whose job is to remove or modify rows in
another work-unit's Manifest table, the recovery task is editing a
**markdown document**, not the source files referenced inside that
document's table. Listing those source files in the recovery task's
Manifest re-introduces the same Manifest Conflict the recovery task was
created to resolve.

Live evidence (2026-05-02): E2-F3-S2-T5 was materialised to remove
``pyproject.toml`` + ``Makefile`` rows from E2-F3-S2-T1's Manifest. The
factory wrote those source-file paths into T5's own Manifest. Result:
the next ``validate-backlog`` run reported the same Manifest Conflict on
``pyproject.toml`` (now claimed by 5 tasks including T5) and ``Makefile``
(now claimed by T1 + T5). The cascade's "fix" reintroduced the bug.

Fix: ``plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/task-factory.md`` adds an explicit
"spec-correction recovery tasks must list ONLY the work-unit markdown"
section. This test pins the rule by-content via the existing
``test_security_review_scope.py`` pattern.
