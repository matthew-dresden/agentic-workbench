"""End-to-end tests for the validation-gate bug-escalation lifecycle (ADR-06).

Covers the second trigger for task-factory: an executor working on a validation-gate
task (empty Changes Manifest, Approach that forbids production-code changes) surfaces
out-of-scope production bugs, emits a proposal JSON directly via `write_proposal`
(bypassing the amendment pipeline), and the SKILL-equivalent call path materialises
drafts at the config-driven default status (in-queue by default; AC-189-8). Key invariants verified here:

- No amendment pending-request file is produced (validation-gate path does not go
  through `request-amendment` -> `manifest-amender` -> `reject-amendment`).
- No rejected-requests archive is produced (no amendment to reject).
- The proposal JSON lands on disk and is schema-valid.
- Materialisation creates one draft `.md` per proposed task with the config-driven
  default status (in-queue by default) and a matching row in `BACKLOG.md`.
- The source validation-gate task is NOT automatically blocked; its status is
  unchanged by the escalation (the source's own review pipeline remains in control).
- `list_proposals` surfaces the pending proposal to the operator.

The functions under test (`write_proposal`, `materialise_proposal`, `list_proposals`)
are flow-agnostic -- they behave identically regardless of whether the caller is the
blocker-resolver agent (amendment-reject trigger) or the executor agent (validation-
gate trigger). This test exercises the second entry point end-to-end.

## Description

Run the existing verification suite and report pass / fail. Do NOT change production
code. This task is a validation gate per ADR-06; any out-of-scope production bugs
surfaced MUST be emitted via `write-proposal` rather than fixed in-scope.
