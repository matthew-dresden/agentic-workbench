"""Issue #140 regression: orchestrate SKILL must forbid recap-prose turn endings.

Background: Claude Code's Stop event fires when the model's turn ends
without a tool call. The Stop hook's block decision arrives AFTER that --
if the orchestrator emitted a prose recap as its final assistant message
(e.g. ``Next: log T4 verdicts and re-invoke executor.``), Claude Code
considers the turn done and the orchestrator effectively terminates.

Live evidence (2026-05-02T00:19): the session log showed
``※ recap: ... Next: log T4 verdicts and re-invoke executor.`` followed
by a Stop event, the hook's block decision, and orchestrator
self-termination.

Fix: SKILL.md adds an explicit rule that every turn MUST end with EITHER
a tool call OR a ``uv run workbench next`` invocation; recap-prose is
forbidden. This test pins the rule by-content via the existing
``test_security_review_scope.py`` / ``test_executor_review_pass_terminality.py``
pattern.
