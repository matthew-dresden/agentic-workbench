"""Issue #137 regression: manifest-amender must reject (or auto-recommend dep)
when an amendment adds a file already claimed by another task's Manifest.

Background: the manifest-amender judges a `tdd_green_production_fix`
amendment for scope minimality, justification coherence, and approach
authorisation. It did NOT check whether the new file is already claimed
by another task's Manifest -- so amendments that introduce Manifest
Conflicts were approved, the source task transitioned to ``blocked`` on
the next ``validate-backlog``, and the recovery cascade had to clean up
after the fact.

Fix: ``plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/manifest-amender.md`` adds a fourth
pre-filter rule -- a "pre-conflict check" that scans every other
work-unit's Manifest before approving. Reject (or auto-recommend dep)
on conflict. This test pins the rule by-content via the existing
``test_manifest_amender_scope.py`` pattern.
