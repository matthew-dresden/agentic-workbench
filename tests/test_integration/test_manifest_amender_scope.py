"""Issue #127 regression: manifest-amender SCOPE must not require requested files
to already be in the Manifest.

The manifest amender is a runtime prompt the LLM reads via Claude Agent
SDK; there is no Python entry point to call-and-assert against. This
test pins the prompt's canonical SCOPE-rule language by-content so a
future edit cannot silently re-introduce the buggy framing.

Bug: at runtime the manifest amender confirmed APPROACH_AUTH PASS and
JUSTIFICATION_COHERENCE PASS on a legitimate ``tdd_green_production_fix``
amendment that requested adding two files (``services/api/pyproject.toml``
+ ``uv.lock``) to E2-F3-S2-T1's Changes Manifest. The amender then FAILed
on SCOPE because "the requested files are not in the Changes Manifest"
-- which is the entire purpose of an amendment. Issue #127.

Fix: ``plugin/workbench-orchestrate/agents/manifest-amender.md`` SCOPE rule (rule 2)
now contains an explicit "Critical (issue #127)" sub-section that:
  1. Forbids using "the requested file is not in the current Changes
     Manifest" as a SCOPE-failure reason.
  2. References the deterministic pre-filter rule that already verified
     each requested file is present in the staged diff.
  3. References the Layer-3 post-check that verifies AC-FINAL-015 after
     `apply-amendment` runs.
  4. Re-states the SCOPE evaluation criterion: minimal diff +
     Approach-coherent, not pre-existence in the Manifest.
  5. Includes a self-correcting heuristic ("if you find yourself
     writing 'the requested files are not in the Changes Manifest' as
     a SCOPE-FAIL justification, stop and re-evaluate").

This test asserts each of the five protective fragments is present so
an accidental edit cannot return the bug.
