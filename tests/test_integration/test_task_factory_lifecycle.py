"""End-to-end tests for the task-factory proposal lifecycle.

Scenarios covered:

- A blocker-resolver proposal with two proposed tasks is written, materialised,
  promoted, and visible as in-queue in the BACKLOG.md index.
- A proposal is rejected, its draft archived, and the BACKLOG.md row removed.
- Re-blocking a source task whose prior proposed tasks are unresolved is a no-op
  (materialise raises ProposalError); the skip prevents duplicate proposals.
