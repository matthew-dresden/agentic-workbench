"""Contract pins for the changes-manifest judge commit-attribution check.

The changes-manifest judge must validate two distinct assertions:
1. Every STAGED file appears in the task's Changes Manifest (pre-existing check).
2. Every file in the task's COMMITS (git log origin/main..HEAD) appears in the
   task's Changes Manifest -- the commit-attribution check.

Assertion 2 catches the scenario where the executor accidentally amended a
sibling task's commit and bundled the sibling's file under this task's commit.
Previously that surfaced only as a deadlocked manifest-mismatch on the
bundled-into task.

These tests pin the contract by:
- Verifying the judge prompt instructs the agent to run `git log --name-only`
  (or equivalent) to enumerate committed files.
- Verifying the required FAIL message template is present in the prompt.
- Building a fake git-history scenario and asserting the judge's prescribed
  diagnostic logic would surface the violation.
