"""Issue #138 regression: the Stop event must register exactly one hook
(``continue-orchestration.sh``).

The Stop event used to register two hooks -- ``hook-logger.sh`` AND
``continue-orchestration.sh`` -- and the dual-hook registration was a
candidate root cause for the recurring Stop-hook self-termination class:
``hook-logger.sh`` prints nothing on stdout, which Claude Code may
interpret as an implicit "approve" vote that drowns out
``continue-orchestration.sh``'s ``decision: block`` vote.

This test pins the single-hook registration so a future config drift
re-introducing ``hook-logger.sh`` on the Stop event fails CI before merge.
