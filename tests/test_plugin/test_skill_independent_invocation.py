"""Integration tests: each onboarding skill is independently invocable given valid input files.

Exercises AC-191-8: each of the four skills (create-spec, spec-to-backlog,
bootstrap-environment, configure-workbench) MUST be invocable standalone without
requiring the prior skill to have run, given valid pre-existing input files.

These tests verify the FILE SYSTEM CONTRACT each skill reads as input and the
OUTPUT CONTRACT each skill must satisfy, exercised in isolation (no dependency
on prior skill execution). Each skill is tested with pre-populated input files
that match exactly what the skill's SKILL.md specifies it will read.

No LLM calls are made -- the tests assert structural contracts using real
workbench production code (config_loader.load_runtime_config, cli.cmd_validate_backlog).
