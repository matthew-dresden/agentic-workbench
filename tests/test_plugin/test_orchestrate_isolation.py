"""Issue #224 AC-10: orchestrate plugin loads + functions without the authoring plugin.

The split landed two marketplaces in the same repo:

- ``plugin/`` (orchestrate marketplace, ships ``workbench-orchestrate``)
- ``plugin-authoring/`` (authoring marketplace, ships ``workbench-authoring``)

This test pins that the orchestrate side is SELF-CONTAINED: every skill,
agent, hook, and script that orchestrate references resolves under
``plugin/workbench-orchestrate/`` alone -- no cross-marketplace path lookups,
no string references to authoring-side artefacts that would fail when
``plugin-authoring/`` is not registered as a marketplace.

The regression failure mode this catches: a future refactor that
accidentally moves a guard script or agent file out of the orchestrate
plugin breaks the isolation property silently.
