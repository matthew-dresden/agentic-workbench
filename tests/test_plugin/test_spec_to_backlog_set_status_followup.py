"""Structural pin tests for spec-to-backlog/SKILL.md set-status follow-up recommendation.

Verifies that plugin-authoring/workbench-authoring/skills/spec-to-backlog/SKILL.md (AC-194-1):
- Recommends the canonical post-generation follow-up command:
  ``workbench set-status --include "E1" in-queue``
- References ``docs/zero-to-ready.md`` for full bulk-operations documentation.
- Does not use the em-dash character (U+2014) in the relevant section.
- Presents the recommendation in a "Next steps" or similar section within Step 8.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.7.4. Issue: #194.
