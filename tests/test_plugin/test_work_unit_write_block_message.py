"""Issue #224 AC-11: ``guard-work-unit-write.sh`` stderr format is pinned.

The orchestrate plugin's ``guard-work-unit-write.sh`` hook fires on any
Write / Edit to ``backlog/**/*.md``.  Its stderr is operator-facing and
integration tests across the project match on substrings of this format,
so any drift would silently break downstream matching.

This test invokes the script with a fixture stdin payload and asserts
the exact stderr captured from the pre-split baseline
(``docs/plugin-split-0.4.0-baseline.md``).  The shell guard ships in
``plugin/workbench-orchestrate/scripts/`` post-split (issue #224); the
script body itself is byte-for-byte identical to the pre-split version.
