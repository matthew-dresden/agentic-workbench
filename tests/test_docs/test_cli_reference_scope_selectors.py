"""Structural pins for the --include / --exclude scope-selector additions in docs/cli-reference.md.

Verifies that docs/cli-reference.md documents:
- The printer-pages-style ``--include`` / ``--exclude`` flag syntax with worked examples (AC-190-1..4, AC-190-7).
- Single-ID tokens, last-segment range tokens, and mixed comma-separated lists.
- The ``--exclude`` subtraction semantics and evaluation order.
- The complex example: ``--include "E1-E10" --exclude "E5,E7-F3"`` (AC-190-7).
- The ``scope`` subcommand (set / clear / show) with the pre-arm workflow.
- Updated ``start``, ``status``, ``report``, and ``next`` sections mentioning the new flags.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.2. Issue #190.
