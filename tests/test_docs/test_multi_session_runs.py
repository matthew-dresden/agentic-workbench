"""Structural pins for docs/multi-session-runs.md (E4-F7-S1-T3, AC-192-3, AC-192-12).

Verifies that the operator playbook for multi-session runs exists and contains
the required structural elements:

- File existence at the canonical path
- Required top-level sections: Concepts, Prerequisites, Worked example steps,
  Overlap detection, Audit trail, Per-session state layout, Common error messages,
  Cross-references
- Cross-references that resolve to real files on disk
- Code blocks containing expected CLI commands (start, sessions, status, report,
  drain, stop, scope)
- No em-dash characters (U+2014) -- prohibited by workbench coding standards
- AC-192-3: three-session disjoint-scope worked example present
- AC-192-12: per-session --session filter shown for status and report commands

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.4.
Issue: #192.
Companion: tests/test_docs/test_adr_23_named_sessions.py (ADR-23 structural pins).
