"""Structural pins for per-skill quickstart documentation (AC-191-9).

Verifies that docs/skills/<skill>.md quickstart pages exist for the four
marketplace plugin skills: create-spec, spec-to-backlog, bootstrap-environment,
and configure-workbench.

Each quickstart doc must:
- Exist as a readable file.
- Contain the skill name as a heading.
- Describe the purpose of the skill.
- Include usage instructions (invocation example).
- Reference the mpm exemplar as the quality bar (where applicable).
- Document the output contract (what the skill produces).
- Include cross-references to companion docs.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.6.6.
Issue: #191.
