"""Structural pins for docs/zero-to-ready.md chained-skill setup path (AC-191-9).

Verifies that docs/zero-to-ready.md:
- Offers two setup paths: manual (existing) and chained-skill (new).
- Mentions the chained-skill alternative and links to docs/onboarding.md.
- Describes that operators can use the skill chain instead of manual step-by-step setup.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.6.6.
Issue: #191.
