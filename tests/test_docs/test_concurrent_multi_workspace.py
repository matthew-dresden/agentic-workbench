"""Structural pins for docs/concurrent-multi-workspace.md.

Verifies that docs/concurrent-multi-workspace.md (AC-190-12) documents:
- The two-clone pattern: two workspace clones each running a workbench instance
  with disjoint --include scopes so they claim disjoint work-unit sets.
- Prerequisites: a shared git remote and two separate workspace root directories.
- Step-by-step setup instructions for both clones.
- How to verify disjointness before launching instances.
- Scope examples showing mutually exclusive filters (e.g., "E1-E3" and "E4-E6").
- The segue to true intra-workspace concurrency via named sessions.
- Cross-references to cli-reference.md (scope selectors) and zero-to-ready.md.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.2 / AC-190-12. Issue: #190.
