"""Structural pins for docs/glossary.md terminology cohesion (AC-191-10).

Verifies that:
- docs/glossary.md exists and defines all 9 canonical terms from spec section 1.2.
- The glossary contains no em-dash characters (U+2014).
- The canonical term spellings from the spec are actually used consistently in
  docs/ -- no 'Draft' (capitalised) used as a status value where 'draft' (lower)
  is canonical, and no 'session name' / 'session id' drift.
