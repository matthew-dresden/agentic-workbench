"""Structural pins for the 'Stopping a run cleanly' section in docs/zero-to-ready.md.

Verifies that docs/zero-to-ready.md documents (AC-188-3):
- A dedicated 'Stopping a run cleanly' section showing how to drain the
  orchestrator gracefully between work units.
- The ``workbench drain`` command variants: bare, --reason, --cancel, --status.
- The pre-arm pattern: dropping the marker before ``workbench start`` so the
  orchestrator runs exactly one WU then exits.
- The ``workbench drain --status`` check with rc=0 in both states.
- The orchestrator finish-current-WU-then-exit semantics.
- The drain marker consumed (deleted) on orchestrator exit.
- A cross-reference to docs/cli-reference.md for the full drain reference.
- The section appears in the Table of contents.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.3. Issue: #188.
