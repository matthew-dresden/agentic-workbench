"""Structural pins for the operator-draft-workflow section in docs/zero-to-ready.md.

Verifies that docs/zero-to-ready.md documents (AC-189-9):
- The draft status landing workflow: reviewing generated backlog, promoting selectively
  or bulk-promoting via ``workbench promote --all``.
- The ``workbench promote <id>`` single-unit promotion command.
- The ``workbench promote --all`` bulk-promotion command.
- The default-status config key ``backlog.default_status_for_new_work_units``.
- That existing workspaces without the new config key continue to land WUs in ``in-queue``.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.1 (draft WorkUnitStatus).
Issue: #189.
