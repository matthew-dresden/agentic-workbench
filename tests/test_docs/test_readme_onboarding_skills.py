"""Structural pins for README.md onboarding-skills feature list (AC-191-9).

Verifies that README.md:
- Mentions the four new onboarding marketplace skills (create-spec, spec-to-backlog,
  configure-workbench, bootstrap-environment).
- Links to docs/onboarding.md as the chained-skill operator workflow hub.
- Describes that operators can use the skill chain as an alternative to manual setup.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.6.6.
Issue: #191.
