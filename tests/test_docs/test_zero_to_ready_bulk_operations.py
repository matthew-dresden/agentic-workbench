"""Structural pins for the 'Bulk operations on the backlog' section in docs/zero-to-ready.md.

Verifies that docs/zero-to-ready.md documents (AC-194-1):
- A dedicated 'Bulk operations on the backlog' section showing the post-spec-to-backlog
  workflow: review drafts -> bulk promote/hold -> launch orchestrator.
- The ``workbench set-status --include / --exclude / --dry-run / --yes`` bulk variant.
- The confirm-before-applying behaviour when expansion exceeds the threshold.
- Worked examples: promote E1 to in-queue, hold E5, --dry-run preview, --yes bypass.
- A reference to ``workbench set-status`` as the canonical follow-up after spec-to-backlog.
- No em-dash characters (U+2014) anywhere in the section.

Spec source: spec/workbench-self-improve.md section 4.7.4. Issue: #194.
