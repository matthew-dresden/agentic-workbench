You are a meticulous environment bootstrapper. Your goal is to prepare every target repository listed in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` (or gathered interactively from the operator) so that `make validate` passes without manual intervention beyond yes/no confirmations.

After every significant step you run a self-verify sanity check. On the first failure you log the error and retry the step once. On persistent failure (second consecutive failure of the same step) you pause and present the operator with a clear diagnostic and suggested fix before proceeding.

---

## Step 1 -- Read the target-repo list

Read `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` and extract the `repos:` section:

```
Read backlog/config/workbench.yaml
```

Parse the `repos:` list. Each entry must provide:
- `repo` -- the `org/name` identifier
- `checkout_directory` -- local path where the repo should live
- `default_branch` -- branch to check out after clone

If `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` is absent, does not exist, or its `repos:` key is empty, ask the operator interactively:

> "I could not find a repos list in backlog/config/workbench.yaml. Please provide the repos you want bootstrapped, one per line in the format `org/repo /local/checkout/path branch`. Enter a blank line when done."

Wait for the operator's input. Parse each line. If the operator provides no repos, report:

> "[BOOTSTRAP_SKIP] No repos provided. Nothing to bootstrap."

and exit cleanly.

### Self-verify after Step 1

- Confirm at least one repo entry was parsed with a non-empty `checkout_directory`.
- If the parsed list is empty after reading both sources, escalate: "Persistent failure: no target repos found in workbench.yaml and operator provided none. Cannot continue."

---

## Step 2 -- Bootstrap each repo in sequence

For each repo in the list, execute Steps 2a through 2d in order.

### Step 2a -- Clone the repository

Check whether `checkout_directory` already exists:

```bash
test -d "<checkout_directory>/.git" && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"
```

If `MISSING`: clone the repo:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/<repo>.git" "<checkout_directory>" --branch "<default_branch>"
```

Report: `[REPO_CLONE] <repo> cloned to <checkout_directory>`

**Self-verify after clone**:

```bash
test -d "<checkout_directory>/.git" && echo "clone present" || echo "clone missing"
```

On `clone missing` (first attempt):
- Log: `[RETRY_CLONE] Clone verification failed for <repo>. Retrying...`
- Re-run the clone command.
- Re-run the verification. On second failure: pause and report:

> "[ESCALATE] Persistent failure: clone of <repo> to <checkout_directory> failed twice. Diagnostic: verify network access to github.com and that the path <checkout_directory> is writable. Suggested fix: run `git clone https://github.com/<repo>.git <checkout_directory>` manually and confirm it succeeds, then re-run this skill."

Do not continue to Step 2b for this repo until the clone is verified present. Ask the operator: "Would you like to skip this repo and continue with the rest? (yes/no)"

If `EXISTS`: report: `[REPO_EXISTS] <checkout_directory> already present -- skipping clone`

### Step 2b -- Detect and install the asdf toolchain

Check for a `.tool-versions` file:

```bash
test -f "<checkout_directory>/.tool-versions" && echo "FOUND" || echo "MISSING"
```

If `MISSING`: report:
`[TOOL_VERSIONS_SKIP] No .tool-versions found in <checkout_directory> -- skipping asdf install`
and proceed to Step 2c.

If `FOUND`: read the file and install each tool version:

```bash
cat "<checkout_directory>/.tool-versions"
```

For each line `<plugin> <version>`, run:

```bash
asdf install <plugin> <version>
```

After all plugins are installed, set local versions:

```bash
cd "<checkout_directory>" && asdf install
```

Report: `[ASDF_INSTALL] Toolchain installed for <repo> from .tool-versions`

**Self-verify after asdf install**:

```bash
cd "<checkout_directory>" && asdf current
```

Confirm the output lists every plugin from `.tool-versions`. If any plugin is missing (first attempt):
- Log: `[RETRY_ASDF] Tool verification failed for <repo>. Retrying asdf install...`
- Re-run `asdf install` inside the checkout directory.
- Re-run `asdf current`. On second failure: pause and report:

> "[ESCALATE] Persistent failure: asdf tools not installed for <repo> after two attempts. Diagnostic: check that asdf is installed (`asdf --version`) and that each plugin in .tool-versions has its plugin added (`asdf plugin add <plugin>`). Suggested fix: run `asdf plugin add <plugin>` for each missing plugin, then re-run this skill."

Ask the operator: "Would you like to skip this repo and continue with the rest? (yes/no)"

### Step 2c -- Run make validate baseline

Run the validation baseline:

```bash
cd "<checkout_directory>" && make validate
```

Report progress every time a sub-target completes (e.g. lint, typecheck, test). On success:

`[VALIDATE_PASS] <repo>: make validate passed`

On failure (exit code != 0): pause and report:

> "[VALIDATE_FAIL] <repo>: make validate failed. Diagnostic: see the output above for the first failing sub-target. Suggested fix: resolve the reported error, then re-run this skill or run `make validate` manually inside <checkout_directory>."

**Self-verify after make validate**:

Run `make validate` a second time only if the first attempt failed after a retry:

On first failure:
- Log: `[RETRY_VALIDATE] make validate failed for <repo>. Retrying once...`
- Re-run `make validate`.
- On second failure (persistent): escalate:

> "[ESCALATE] Persistent failure: make validate failed for <repo> twice. Diagnostic: the baseline is not green. A human must resolve the pre-existing failures before this repo can be bootstrapped automatically. Suggested fix: read the error output above, fix the failing test or lint rule, then re-run this skill."

Ask the operator: "Would you like to skip this repo and continue with the rest? (yes/no)"

### Step 2d -- Report per-repo status

After all steps complete for this repo, report a concise summary:

```
[REPO_DONE] <repo>
  clone:         OK / SKIPPED (already present)
  asdf tools:    OK / SKIPPED (no .tool-versions) / ESCALATED
  make validate: PASS / ESCALATED
```

---

## Step 3 -- Final summary

After processing all repos, print a summary table:

```
Bootstrap-environment complete.

Repo                      Clone     Toolchain  Validate
------------------------  --------  ---------  --------
<org>/<repo-1>            OK        OK         PASS
<org>/<repo-2>            SKIPPED   OK         PASS
<org>/<repo-3>            ESCALATED --         --
```

If any repo was escalated, remind the operator:

> "One or more repos could not be fully bootstrapped automatically. Review the [ESCALATE] messages above, resolve the issues, and re-run `claude run workbench-authoring:bootstrap-environment` to retry."

If all repos succeeded:

> "All repos are bootstrapped and `make validate` is green. You are ready to run `make start` or invoke the `configure-workbench` skill to tune your workbench.yaml."

---

## Self-critique loop (bounded)

The retry loop on a failing `make validate` must terminate -- either when
every repo reports PASS (success) or when the iteration budget is exhausted
(escalation). Use the helpers in `src/workbench/skill_state.py`:

- Before retrying a repo, call
  `read_checkpoint("bootstrap-environment", workspace_root)` to read the
  previous counter (returns `None` on the first pass).
- When all repos pass `make validate`
  (`unresolved_count <= SKILL_QUALITY_THRESHOLD`), call
  `emit_audit("bootstrap-environment", SKILL_AUDIT_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_REACHED, {...}, workspace_root)`
  and exit success.
- Otherwise increment the checkpoint via `write_checkpoint(...)` and retry.
- When the iteration reaches `SKILL_MAX_ITERATIONS` (defined in
  `src/workbench/constants.py`), call
  `emit_audit("bootstrap-environment", SKILL_AUDIT_MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED, {"unresolved": ...}, workspace_root)`
  and exit non-zero with the `[ESCALATE]` message so the operator can intervene.

The audit tags `[SKILL_MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED]` and
`[SKILL_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_REACHED]` flow through the existing report and
hook-tail pipelines without any new infrastructure.
