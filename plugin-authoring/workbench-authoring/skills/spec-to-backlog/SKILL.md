You are a meticulous backlog architect. Your goal is to transform a `spec/<project-name>.md` into a complete backlog: `BACKLOG.md` plus work-unit `.md` files under `backlog/` -- at the depth and rigour required by `workbench validate-backlog` and the orchestrator's executor / judge pipeline.

**Quality bar (two-source resolution)**: Every leaf task file MUST contain all 15 canonical sections enumerated in Step 1 below (the embedded skeleton is the authoritative source). Optionally, when the workspace points the skill at an in-workspace exemplar via `skills.exemplar_backlog_path` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`, also internalise that exemplar's depth as a reference. The embedded section list is the floor; the workspace exemplar (when present) is an additional reference for richer wording and shape.

**Default status for new work units: `draft`** (controlled by `backlog.default_status_for_new_work_units` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`; default is `draft` when that key is absent). Every generated task file MUST open with `## Status: draft` unless the operator overrides the config.

**Iterate-until-perfect loop**: Self-critique at THREE granularities after every draft. Revise. Re-score. Repeat until all unresolved items are zero or the iteration budget (`skills.max_iterations` in `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`, default 5) is reached. If `max_iterations` is reached without converging, emit a `[BLOCKED]` audit comment listing the unresolved rubric items -- do NOT silently ship a sub-quality artefact.

---

## Step 1 -- Internalise the canonical task-file skeleton (and the workspace exemplar when configured)

Before writing anything, ensure you have the canonical task-file structure firmly in mind. This skill is application-agnostic: it does NOT depend on any specific workspace having a particular exemplar file.

**Step 1a -- Resolve the exemplar path (optional)**

Read `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` and look for `skills.exemplar_backlog_path`. If the key is present and the file at that path exists, read both files:

```
Read <skills.exemplar_backlog_path value>            # the workspace's representative BACKLOG.md
Read <a representative leaf task file under it>      # any *-T*.md in a 4-level hierarchy under that exemplar
```

If `skills.exemplar_backlog_path` is absent OR the file does not exist, skip the file read entirely. Do NOT default to any hardcoded path. The 15-section list below is sufficient by itself to author a passing backlog.

**Step 1b -- The 15 canonical task-file sections (authoritative quality bar)**

Every leaf task `.md` file MUST contain these 15 sections, in this order:

1. `# {id}: {title}` -- top-level heading with full task ID
2. `## Status: <value>` where `<value>` is one of `draft`, `in-queue`, `in-progress`, `in-review`, `done`, `blocked`, `declined`, `hold`. **CONSTRAINT (issue #229)**: `draft` is ONLY VALID for Task work units. The validator's `_check_status_enum` rule (see `src/workbench/backlog/manager.py`) rejects `draft` on Epic / Feature / Story with `Status "draft" is only valid for Task work units; <ID> is type <Type>.`. For non-Task levels the operator may intend a "not-ready" state -- map that intent to `hold` (the orchestrator's claim sweep promotes `in-queue` -> claimed; `hold` / `draft` / `declined` all keep the WU paused).
3. `## Target Repository` -- `Repo:` + `Branch:` fields
4. `## Description` -- full prose description (not a one-liner; explains WHY and what the implementation does)
5. `### Definition of Ready` -- 5 task-tailored checklist items (NOT generic boilerplate; each item is specific to this task's prerequisites)
6. `### Depends On This` -- forward reverse-dependency table (`| ID | Title | Status |`); row `| none | | |` when nothing depends on this task
7. `### Approach` -- task-specific numbered TDD steps (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR) with exact file paths, line citations, and pytest commands for THIS task -- NOT a generic 11-step template
8. `### Code Standards` -- with ALL six subsections:
   - `#### Critical Rules (Violation = Automatic Rejection)` -- the 8 critical rules
   - `#### Architecture Principles` -- SOLID, DRY, 12-Factor
   - `#### Testing Rules` -- TDD, coverage, parametrize, no stubs
   - `#### Git Rules` -- stage only manifest files, no --no-verify, no commits from executor
   - `#### Security Rules` -- no secrets, no eval(), no bypassing guard hooks
   - `#### Error Handling Contract` -- ONE subsection only: generic contract followed by task-specific error paths (do NOT add a second `#### Error Handling Contract` subsection)
9. `### Related Specifications` -- spec section citations + GitHub issue + companion ADRs
10. `## Dependencies` -- table of upstream tasks this task depends on (`| ID | Title | Status |`)
11. `## Acceptance Criteria` -- task-specific ACs tied to spec section numbers or AC-N identifiers from spec Section 6; no `AC-XCUT-N` cross-cutting blocks
12. `## Changes Manifest` -- the canonical 2-column form `| File | Change |`. EXACTLY two columns; the validator's `parse_manifest` rejects any other column count with `ManifestParseError: Manifest row must have exactly 2 columns`. Each row's File cell is a backtick-wrapped relative path (or a sentinel like ``<source-drift-fix-targets-determined-at-execution>`` when the file list is undetermined); the Change cell is one of `add`, `modify`, `delete` (lowercase). Multi-repo work units encode the repo in the File cell as `` `<org/repo>` -- <path> `` (no per-row Repo column). The `## Target Repository` block at the top of the work-unit file is where Repo / Branch live; the Manifest carries paths only. NEVER use glob patterns (``*`` or ``**``) -- use a sentinel instead. See `docs/backlog-contract.md` 'Changes Manifest' section.
13. `## Definition of Done` -- ~9 task-tailored checklist items that reference the actual manifest files (no paths that aren't in the Changes Manifest unless suffixed `(ref)`)
14. `## TDD Cycle Log` -- header only (orchestrator fills entries at execution time); NO prose explanations or entry-format examples
15. `## Comments` -- header only (blank at authoring time)

---

## Step 2 -- Resolve the input spec path (and optional discovery-artifact directory)

The skill accepts the spec path via skill ``args`` (issue #221 A2). If
``args`` is non-empty, treat its first token as the spec path and skip
the prompt below entirely. Otherwise ask the operator:

> Which spec file should I decompose into a backlog? (Provide the path, e.g. `spec/<project-name>.md`)

If the operator already provided the path in their invocation message, skip this step and proceed.

**Optional second positional argument: `discovery_artifacts_dir`** (issue
#221 A1). If a SECOND token follows the spec path in ``args``, treat it
as the path to a directory of discovery artifacts (typically
`spec/<run-name>/_workspace/`) produced by a prior discovery pass that
the spec was authored from. Recognised artefact filenames:

- `verification_matrix.md` -- row-per-claim verification grid
- `ci_failures.md` -- CI-failure rows the spec must address
- `test_coverage_audit.md` -- coverage-gap rows the spec must address
- `ambiguities.md` -- unresolved-question rows the spec must clarify
- `scope_creep.md` -- out-of-scope rows the spec must explicitly mark

When the discovery directory is supplied, the rubric items added in
Steps 4b and 5b for "Discovery-artifact coverage" become MANDATORY: every
row in every recognised artefact file must be covered by at least one
leaf task's `## Acceptance Criteria` or `## Approach`. A spec authored
from a discovery run can omit an AC for a discovered finding and pass
the spec-AC -> leaf-task rubric silently; the discovery-coverage rubric
is the orthogonal safety net.

When the discovery directory is NOT supplied (legacy invocations and
specs that were not authored from a discovery run), the
discovery-coverage rubric items are skipped and Steps 4b / 5b behave as
they did before -- there is no behavioural change for callers that do
not pass the optional argument.

---

## Step 3 -- Read and internalise the spec

Read the entire spec file:

```
Read <spec-path>
```

Extract:
- The project name and all functional requirements (FRs)
- All acceptance criteria (AC-N identifiers from the spec's Section 6 or equivalent)
- All constraints, NFRs, and implementation notes
- The target repository and branch

Record the FR list for coverage validation in the iterate-until-perfect loop.

---

## Step 4 -- Epic decomposition (iterate-until-perfect granularity 1)

### 4a -- Draft the Epic -> Feature -> Story -> Task tree

Decompose every spec FR into the 4-level hierarchy. Rules:
- **No skipped levels**: every path from root to leaf must be Epic -> Feature -> Story -> Task
- **Every spec FR must have at least one Epic** (or be explicitly marked N/A with justification)
- **Epic IDs**: `E<N>` (e.g. `E1`, `E2`)
- **Feature IDs**: `E<N>-F<M>` (e.g. `E1-F1`, `E1-F2`)
- **Story IDs**: `E<N>-F<M>-S<P>` (e.g. `E1-F1-S1`)
- **Task IDs**: `E<N>-F<M>-S<P>-T<Q>` (e.g. `E1-F1-S1-T1`)
- **Cross-epic dependencies** expressed at the Feature level minimum (not at the Task level alone) to keep cycle-detection feasible in `workbench validate-backlog`

### 4b -- Self-critique at Epic granularity

Score each item PASS or FAIL. A FAIL is an unresolved item:

1. **FR coverage**: every spec FR has at least one Epic (or explicit N/A). FAIL if any FR is unaddressed.
2. **No skipped levels**: every Epic decomposes to Features, every Feature to Stories, every Story to Tasks. FAIL if any level is skipped.
3. **Balance**: no single Epic contains more than 70% of all tasks. FAIL if decomposition is lopsided.
4. **Spec coverage**: every AC-N from spec Section 6 is addressed by at least one leaf task's Acceptance Criteria. FAIL if any AC-N is orphaned.
5. **Dependency graph is a DAG**: no circular dependencies. FAIL if any cycle exists (pre-validate mentally).
6. **Cross-epic deps at Feature level**: no Task-level cross-epic dependency (use Feature-level). FAIL if any such dep exists.
7. **Discovery-artifact coverage** (issue #221 A1): when Step 2 supplied a `discovery_artifacts_dir`, every row in every recognised artefact file (`verification_matrix.md`, `ci_failures.md`, `test_coverage_audit.md`, `ambiguities.md`, `scope_creep.md`) must be covered by at least one leaf task in the drafted tree -- either via a planned AC, an explicit task title that names the discovery row, or an Approach step that references it. FAIL if any artefact row is orphaned (no covering leaf task). Skipped when `discovery_artifacts_dir` is absent.

### 4c -- Revise

Address each FAIL item. Re-score. Repeat until score is zero or `skills.max_iterations` is reached.

**Convergence protocol**: if `skills.max_iterations` is reached with score > 0:

```
[BLOCKED] spec-to-backlog Epic decomposition reached max_iterations=<N> without converging.
Unresolved rubric items:
- <item number>: <detail> -- <suggested-fix>
...
Please clarify the above items and re-run the skill.
```

---

## Step 5 -- Author task files one at a time (iterate-until-perfect granularity 2)

**Resume support** (issue #221 A3): before authoring, call
``read_per_task_checkpoint("spec-to-backlog", workspace_root)`` from
``src/workbench/skill_state.py``. If the returned checkpoint is non-None,
treat its ``completed_task_ids`` as the set of leaf tasks already
authored in a prior interrupted run -- skip those IDs and resume from
the first un-completed task. After each successful task write, call
``write_per_task_checkpoint(...)`` with the cumulative set of completed
IDs. The two-file split (``spec-to-backlog.json`` for the iteration
counter, ``spec-to-backlog-tasks.json`` for the completed-task set)
means a re-invocation after a crash resumes mid-backlog instead of
regenerating every file.

For each leaf task in the Epic -> Feature -> Story -> Task tree:

### 5a -- Write the task file

Write the task `.md` file to `backlog/<epic-id>-<epic-slug>/<feature-id>-<feature-slug>/<story-id>-<story-slug>/<task-id>.md` using the `Write` tool. The file MUST contain all 15 canonical sections listed in Step 1b.

**Fan-out** (issue #221 A5): if the leaf-task count from Step 4 strictly exceeds `skills.fan_out_threshold` (default 10), spawn one general-purpose sub-Agent per Feature to author that Feature's leaf tasks in parallel rather than writing them serially. The sub-Agent receives the canonical-section list (Step 1b) verbatim plus the Feature's leaf-task IDs and titles. Serial authoring remains the default when the leaf-task count is at or below the threshold.

**Forbidden patterns** (the skill MUST NOT generate any of these):
- Multiple `#### Error Handling Contract` subsections (general + this-task variants). Use ONE subsection; task-specific content follows the generic content under the same heading.
- `AC-XCUT-N` cross-cutting AC blocks inside `## Acceptance Criteria`. The Code Standards section encodes program-wide rules; ACs must be task-specific.
- Placeholder text in `### Depends On This` such as `_(filled in by validate-backlog reverse-dep scan at run time)_`. Compute the real reverse-dep table at backlog-generation time.
- Prose explanations or entry-format examples in `## TDD Cycle Log`. The header alone; the orchestrator fills entries at execution time.
- Generic 11-step Approach templates. Approach steps MUST reference the specific files, lines, and pytest commands for THIS task.
- DoR / DoD items mentioning paths not in this task's Changes Manifest. Either include the path in the Manifest, or rewrite the item behaviourally (no path tokens), or suffix the token with `(ref)`.
- Glob patterns (``*`` or ``**``) in any Manifest row. Use a sentinel like ``<source-drift-fix-targets-determined-at-execution>`` instead and rely on the orchestrator's `manifest_amendment` workflow to concretise the file list at execution time.

**Canonical dep-ID form (issue #229)**: every row in `## Dependencies` and `### Depends On This` MUST have its first column match the regex `E\d+(-F\d+)?(-S\d+)?(-T\d+)?`. Directory names are slugs (e.g., `E16-test-cleanup`) and are NOT valid IDs. Use the bare `E<n>` / `E<n>-F<m>` form. When citing existing-backlog epics, look up the canonical ID from `BACKLOG.md`'s Full Work Unit Index ID column (the first cell of each index row). The validator's `_check_dep_id_format` rule rejects slug-form IDs with `dependency ID '<slug>' does not match the canonical task-ID regex E<n>[-F<n>][-S<n>][-T<n>]`. The `normalize_dep_ids` post-processor pass (Step 5d) rewrites slug-form IDs to canonical form when found.

**Code Standards block (issue #230)**: do NOT re-type the ~50-line Code Standards block in every task file. Call the canonical-block helper instead:

```bash
uv run python -c "from workbench.plugin_helpers.code_standards_template import emit_code_standards_block; from pathlib import Path; print(emit_code_standards_block(Path('<workspace-root>'), task_specific_error_paths=['<unique-to-this-task error 1>', '<error 2>']))"
```

The output starts with `### Code Standards` and ends after the `#### Error Handling Contract` subsection -- paste it verbatim into the task file as section 8 of the 15 canonical sections. Workspaces that want a customised canonical body place a `code-standards-canonical.md` file at the workspace root; the helper resolves the override automatically. The `verify_code_standards_canonical` post-processor pass (Step 5d) reports the count of tasks whose Code Standards block has drifted from the canonical body (check-only, no mutation). See `docs/code-standards-canonical.md`.

**Dependency wiring -- fully resolved at generation time**:
- `## Dependencies` table: every upstream task this task depends on (real WU IDs -- no placeholders).
- `### Depends On This` table: every downstream task that depends on this task (real WU IDs -- no placeholders).
- Manifest-conflict serial-dep chains auto-injected: if two tasks modify the same file, the later task depends on the earlier one so `workbench validate-backlog` Rule 5 (Manifest Conflict Rule) passes from cold start.

**Default status**: Before writing each task file, read `backlog.default_status_for_new_work_units` from `backlog/config/workbench.yaml` (default: `draft` when that key is absent):
- Key absent or set to `draft`: write `## Status: draft` as the second line of the task file.
- Key set to `in-queue` (legacy workspace override): write `## Status: in-queue` as the second line of the task file.

### 5b -- Self-critique at per-Task granularity

Score each item PASS or FAIL:

1. **All 15 canonical sections present and in order** (Status, Target Repository, Description, Definition of Ready, Depends On This, Approach, Code Standards [with all 6 subsections], Related Specifications, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, Changes Manifest, Definition of Done, TDD Cycle Log, Comments). FAIL if any section is missing or out of order.
2. **AC ties to spec**: every AC in `## Acceptance Criteria` references a spec section number or AC-N identifier from spec Section 6. FAIL if any AC is free-floating.
3. **Changes Manifest is concrete**: every file path resolves against the target repo checkout; every entry has an explicit `add` / `modify` / `delete` annotation; no glob patterns. FAIL if any path is ambiguous, annotation is missing, or a glob appears.
4. **Approach is task-specific**: steps reference the exact files and pytest commands for this task -- not a generic template. FAIL if the Approach reads like a copy-paste from another task.
5. **Depends On This is real**: `### Depends On This` contains real WU IDs (or `| none | | |`). FAIL if any placeholder text is present.
6. **Single Error Handling Contract subsection**: exactly one `#### Error Handling Contract` subsection under `### Code Standards`. FAIL if more than one exists.
7. **No AC-XCUT-N blocks** in `## Acceptance Criteria`. FAIL if any cross-cutting AC block is present.
8. **TDD Cycle Log header only**: no prose below the header. FAIL if entry-format examples or prose appear.
9. **DoR / DoD path discipline**: no file paths in DoR or DoD that are not in the Changes Manifest (unless suffixed `(ref)`). FAIL if any such path exists.
10. **Approach-specificity check**: the Approach section names concrete files, line numbers (where applicable), and pytest commands for this task. FAIL if the Approach reads as a generic template substitutable across tasks.
11. **Discovery-artifact coverage at task granularity** (issue #221 A1): when Step 2 supplied a `discovery_artifacts_dir`, if this task is the covering task for any artefact row (from the mapping established at Step 4b item 7), the AC or Approach explicitly cites the artefact row -- either by quoting the row text or by naming the artefact filename + the row identifier (line number, file path, claim ID, etc., depending on the artefact's row shape). FAIL if a discovery-artefact row mapped to this task has no citation in either AC or Approach. Skipped when `discovery_artifacts_dir` is absent or no rows map to this task.
12. **AC-FINAL tier-suffix on non-Python tasks** (issue #228): when this task's Changes Manifest contains zero `.py` paths, the Python-tooling AC-FINAL lines (`AC-FINAL-002` ruff format, `AC-FINAL-003` ruff check, `AC-FINAL-004` mypy, `AC-FINAL-005` pytest tier, `AC-FINAL-006` pytest other tier, `AC-FINAL-008` bandit, `AC-FINAL-014` coverage) MUST carry the explicit suffix `-- N/A for <Tier> Tasks (no Python source authored)`. Tier is derived from the dominant Manifest file extension: `.yml` / `.yaml` -> `YAML`, `.md` -> `Markdown`, `.toml` -> `TOML`, `.tf` / `.hcl` / `.tfvars` -> `HCL`, `.json` -> `JSON`, `.xml` -> `XML`; manifests with multiple non-Python extensions report `Mixed`. FAIL if a non-Python task lacks the suffix on any of those AC-FINAL lines. The `suffix_na_on_non_python_tasks` post-processor pass (Step 5d) deterministically adds the suffix when missing. See `docs/acceptance-criteria-canonical.md`.

### 5c -- Revise

Address each FAIL item. Re-run the per-task rubric. Repeat until score is zero or `skills.max_iterations` is reached. If `max_iterations` is reached without converging, emit a `[BLOCKED]` comment naming the task file and the unresolved items.

### 5d -- Post-process + run validate-backlog (iterate-until-perfect granularity 3)

After writing each task file, FIRST run the deterministic post-processing passes that fix mechanical issues authoring commonly produces (issue #221 A11, A12, A13). The post-processor is pure Python; it covers transforms the LLM cannot reliably do across N files.

**Pass the newly-authored epic directories via `scope_paths`** so the post-processor only walks files this materialisation produced (issue #226). Without `scope_paths`, the helper still defaults to skipping any file with `## Status: done` or `## Status: declined` (terminal-status guard) -- but passing `scope_paths` is the explicit-correctness path the skill MUST follow:

```bash
uv run python -c "from pathlib import Path; from workbench.plugin_helpers import backlog_post_processor as bpp; print(bpp.run_all(Path('backlog'), scope_paths=[Path('backlog/<new-epic-id-1>'), Path('backlog/<new-epic-id-2>')], workspace_root=Path('.')))"
```

The `workspace_root` kwarg lets the `regenerate_backlog_index` pass (issue #225) append the new epic + work-unit rows to an existing `BACKLOG.md` instead of overwriting it. When omitted, the pass no-ops and the skill falls back to its greenfield write path in Step 6.

For each pass that reports a non-zero count, emit one audit row:

```
[POST_PROCESS] <pass_name>: <count> file(s)
```

THEN run validate-backlog:

```bash
uv run workbench validate-backlog
```

On any error:
1. Parse the error message to identify the offending task file.
2. Regenerate (or fix via `Edit`) the offending task file.
3. Re-run the post-processor (with the same `scope_paths`) + `uv run workbench validate-backlog`.
4. Repeat until rc=0.

Repeat for every leaf task until all tasks are written and `validate-backlog` is green. See `docs/skills/backlog-post-processor.md` for the full list of post-processing passes, the `scope_paths` / `force_terminal` arguments, and how to add new ones.

---

## Step 6 -- Write or update BACKLOG.md (append-mode by default)

After all task files are written, produce or extend `BACKLOG.md` so the operator sees the new epic rows alongside any existing ones.

**Append-mode semantics (issue #225)**: the `regenerate_backlog_index` post-processor pass (run via Step 5d's `run_all`, with `scope_paths` + `workspace_root` supplied) handles three cases:

1. **Greenfield** (`BACKLOG.md` does not exist): the skill writes the file from scratch using the canonical shapes shown below.
2. **Append** (`BACKLOG.md` exists with E1...EN already present, materialisation adds EN+1...): existing rows are byte-for-byte preserved; the pass APPENDS one new row per new epic to the Status Summary table and one new row per work unit (any level) to the Full Work Unit Index. The operator never has to merge by hand.
3. **Collision** (a new epic ID already appears in the index with a different file path): the pass raises `BacklogAppendCollisionError` and writes nothing -- the operator re-numbers the new epic or renames the existing directory before retrying.

Pass the workspace root via the `workspace_root` kwarg to `run_all` (Step 5d) so the pass can locate `BACKLOG.md`. When called without `workspace_root`, the pass no-ops (legacy callers preserved).

### Status Summary table

```
| Epic | Draft | In Queue | In Progress | In Review | Done | Blocked | Total |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| E1 -- <epic-title> | N | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | N |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **TOTAL** | N | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | N |
```

All new tasks default to `Draft`; counts in other columns are 0 at generation time.

**Status Summary count semantics** (issue #229; supersedes #221 B6): each cell counts Features + Stories + Tasks under that Epic that hold the column's status. The Epic file itself is NOT counted in any cell (the row IS the epic; counting the epic in its own row would double-count). For an all-in-queue Epic with N Features, M Stories, K Tasks: In Queue column = N + M + K. CONSTRAINT (Step 1b item 2): Epic / Feature / Story cannot hold `draft`; if the operator's intent is "everything paused", expect Features and Stories under Hold and only Tasks under Draft. See `docs/backlog-contract.md` for the worked example.

### Full Work Unit Index

One row per leaf task in 7-column format:

```
| ID | Title | Status | Repo | Branch | Depends On | Changed Files |
|----|-------|--------|------|--------|------------|---------------|
| E1-F1-S1-T1 | <title> | Draft | <org/repo> | <branch> | E1-F1-S1-T0 (if any) | <file1>, <file2> |
```

The total row count in the Full Work Unit Index MUST equal the TOTAL in the Status Summary table.

---

## Step 7 -- Final whole-backlog validation

Run the final validate-backlog pass:

```bash
uv run workbench validate-backlog
```

**Exit conditions** (ALL three must hold simultaneously before the skill exits successfully):

1. `uv run workbench validate-backlog` returns rc=0 with zero errors.
2. Every leaf task passes the per-task rubric (all 10 items scored PASS in Step 5b).
3. BACKLOG.md Status Summary total equals the Full Work Unit Index row count.

If any condition fails, return to the relevant step (Step 5 for per-task issues, Step 6 for BACKLOG.md count mismatch, Step 5d for validate-backlog errors) and re-run Step 7. Repeat until all three conditions pass or `skills.max_iterations` is exhausted.

**Convergence failure protocol** (when `skills.max_iterations` is exhausted without all three conditions passing):

```
[BLOCKED] spec-to-backlog final validation reached max_iterations=<N> without converging.
Unresolved conditions:
- <condition number>: <detail> -- <suggested-fix>
...
Please fix the above issues and re-run the skill.
```

Do NOT silently exit when `max_iterations` is reached -- emitting a `[BLOCKED]` comment with the unresolved conditions is mandatory so the operator knows exactly what to fix.

---

## Step 8 -- Emit the quality-reference audit comment and success message

After all three exit conditions pass, emit a provenance audit comment naming the exemplar consulted in Step 1a. When `skills.exemplar_backlog_path` was set, emit the resolved path; when it was absent, emit the literal token `<embedded-canonical-sections>` so the audit trail records that no external exemplar was consulted:

```
[QUALITY_REFERENCE] <resolved-exemplar-path-or-embedded-canonical-sections>
```

This audit line is mandatory -- it records what quality reference (workspace exemplar or embedded section list) was consulted so the orchestrator's audit trail captures provenance for every skill invocation that authors a backlog.

When Step 2 supplied a `discovery_artifacts_dir` (issue #221 A1), ALSO emit a discovery-coverage audit line beneath the quality-reference line:

```
[DISCOVERY_COVERAGE] <covered>/<total> rows from <discovery_artifacts_dir>
```

Where `<covered>` is the number of recognised-artefact rows mapped to a covering leaf task and `<total>` is the total number of recognised-artefact rows found in the directory. The two numbers MUST be equal at this point because the Step 4b item 7 and Step 5b item 11 rubric items fail the convergence loop when they are not -- the audit line is a record of the coverage check having run, not a place to report shortfalls. Skip the line entirely when `discovery_artifacts_dir` was not supplied.

Then emit the success message:

> Backlog written:
> - `BACKLOG.md` -- Status Summary + Full Work Unit Index (<N> tasks total)
> - `backlog/<epic-id>/.../<task-id>.md` -- one file per task (<N> files)
> - All tasks default to `draft` status
> - `workbench validate-backlog` passes with rc=0
>
> Next: review the generated epics in the `draft` status, then release whole epics
> (or individual tasks) for autonomous orchestrator work using `workbench set-status`:
>
> ```bash
> # Release the first epic for autonomous work (canonical follow-up after spec-to-backlog)
> uv run workbench set-status --include "E1" in-queue
>
> # Preview which tasks would be promoted before committing (safe dry-run)
> uv run workbench set-status --include "E1" --dry-run in-queue
>
> # Release multiple epics at once
> uv run workbench set-status --include "E1,E2" in-queue
>
> # Place an epic on hold while releasing others
> uv run workbench set-status --include "E5" hold
> ```
>
> For full bulk-operations documentation, including threshold confirmation and the
> `--exclude` flag, see `docs/zero-to-ready.md` (Bulk operations on the backlog).

## Self-critique rubric for spec-to-backlog

Score each item as PASS or FAIL. A FAIL is an unresolved item.

**Decomposition coverage (items 1-2)**

1. **Every spec FR has at least one Epic**: no functional requirement from the spec is unaddressed (or has an explicit N/A justification). FAIL if any FR is orphaned.
2. **No skipped hierarchy levels**: every Epic decomposes Epic -> Feature -> Story -> Task with no levels skipped. FAIL if any intermediate level is absent.

**Per-task depth (items 3-5)**

3. **All 15 canonical sections present in every task file** (in order). FAIL if any task is missing a section.
4. **AC ties to spec section**: every AC in `## Acceptance Criteria` references a spec section number or AC-N from spec Section 6. FAIL if any AC is free-floating.
5. **Changes Manifest is concrete**: every file path resolves against the target repo checkout; every entry has an `add` / `modify` / `delete` annotation; no glob patterns. FAIL if any manifest entry is ambiguous or contains a glob.

**Dependency integrity (items 6-7)**

6. **Dependency graph is a DAG**: no circular dependencies. FAIL if any cycle exists.
7. **Both directions fully wired**: `## Dependencies` (upstream) AND `### Depends On This` (downstream) tables contain real WU IDs resolved at generation time. FAIL if any placeholder text is present in either table.

**Forbidden patterns (items 8-10)**

8. **Single Error Handling Contract subsection per task**: exactly one `#### Error Handling Contract` subsection under `### Code Standards` per task. FAIL if more than one exists in any task.
9. **No AC-XCUT-N blocks**: `## Acceptance Criteria` contains only task-specific ACs. FAIL if any cross-cutting AC-XCUT-N block appears.
10. **No placeholder Depends On This text**: no `_(filled in by validate-backlog ...)_` or similar. FAIL if any placeholder is present.

**Validation gate (item 11)**

11. **validate-backlog rc=0**: `uv run workbench validate-backlog` returns zero errors. FAIL if any error remains.

## Output contract

- **Output files**: `BACKLOG.md` + work-unit `.md` files under `backlog/` in canonical 7-column format
- **Default status**: `draft` for all new work units (overridable via `backlog.default_status_for_new_work_units` in `workbench.yaml`)
- **Per-task depth**: every task contains all 15 canonical sections enumerated in Step 1b (the embedded skeleton is the authoritative quality bar; an optional workspace exemplar adds a reference for richer wording)
- **Quality gate**: rubric score must be zero unresolved items AND `validate-backlog` rc=0 before the skill exits
- **Provenance**: `[QUALITY_REFERENCE]` audit comment emitted on completion naming either the resolved workspace exemplar path or the literal `<embedded-canonical-sections>` token

## Self-critique loop (bounded)

The rubric-driven self-critique loop must terminate -- either when scoring
reports zero unresolved items AND `validate-backlog` returns rc=0 (success)
or when the iteration budget is exhausted (escalation). Use the helpers in
`src/workbench/skill_state.py` to make the bound observable:

- On every iteration call `read_checkpoint("spec-to-backlog", workspace_root)`
  to load the previous counter (returns `None` first time).
- When the rubric reports `unresolved_count <= SKILL_QUALITY_THRESHOLD` AND
  `validate-backlog` returns rc=0, call
  `emit_audit("spec-to-backlog", SKILL_AUDIT_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_REACHED, {...}, workspace_root)`
  and exit success.
- Otherwise increment the checkpoint via `write_checkpoint(...)` and continue.
- When the iteration reaches `skills.max_iterations` (from
  `backlog/config/workbench.yaml`, falling back to `SKILL_MAX_ITERATIONS`
  defined in `src/workbench/constants.py`), call
  `emit_audit("spec-to-backlog", SKILL_AUDIT_MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED, {"unresolved": ...}, workspace_root)`
  and exit non-zero so the orchestrator surfaces the unresolved items.

The audit tags `[SKILL_MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED]` and
`[SKILL_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_REACHED]` flow through the existing report and
hook-tail pipelines without any new infrastructure.
